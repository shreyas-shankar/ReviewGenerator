     "comments": "We are a family of allergy sufferers, so we know our tissues. Kleenex Super Soft are comforting to the nose, without added lotion to smear up our eyeglass lenses when we clean them. Also, I can't put my finger on why, but each tissue seems to last significantly longer than a typical tissue."

     "comments": "These tissues aren't going to sparkle and take you away to a magical land. But hey, what did you expect? They're tissues.\nRealistically, these tissues do what they'e supposed to... they catch your snot, which is gross. They aren't the softest tissues I've ever used, but they aren't the most rough either. The boxes are nearly twice the size of your standard tissue box (or at least they look like it). Apparently the size of the box is both a plus and con. If you like more tissues or doing crafts with large, leftover boxes (way to go re-users), then a big box is for you. If you don't like reaching your hand into a large tissue box, then you probably won't like this. Frankly, these are the largest tissue boxes I've ever seen.\nAfter having owned this little collection of giant tissue boxes for some time now, I can tell you the real incentive to buy these tissues is that you will get a LOT of them. I sneeze almost every day since it's Spring and I can't see a time in the near future when I run out of tissues. Maybe it says somewhere in the description exactly how many tissues you're getting, but I think they could easily make a commercial for these using a \"how many tissues does it take to get to the bottom of our tissue boxes\" commercial slogan. If someone tries this, let me know because now I'm curious."

While it's not technically a signal booster, in effect it does the same thing, creating a stronger and better network throughout your house. I was skeptical about the skimpy setup instructions included, but all you have to do is to plug the first unit into your modem with the supplied ethernet cable, plug it in, download the Google Wi-Fi app and the app will walk you through the entire remaining setup process. Couldn't be easier. If you're a Comcast customer with a dual band modem/router, the Google system will work without disabling the Comcast router and both systems will work in parallel. You can, however, disable the Comcast router if you desire."

I could barely achieve 8-9 Mbps on a good day, and it would often drop to 0.xx. I asked them for a faster Internet and got a 75 Mbps plan. Once again, it averaged 8-9 Mbps on a good day. No change whatsoever, compared to the 25 Mbps plan. Then I bought Google. The moment I set it up (easy) and measured the speed: boooom > constant 89 Mbps!!! Ten times more than the previous average. And even more than the 75 Mbps plan. HIghly recommended."

I cant believe it.\nTo make it short:\nPro:\n- Nice coverage\n- Good Speed\n- Easy to \"not\" configure (bc you literally cant configure anything) :)\nNegative:\n1.) If you can connect your router into google wifi your wont have much problems, but google will get all your traffic (if you dont care, this is perfect for you).\n2.) I want to use it behind a router, this is not possible, atleast not with the mesh feature, also it doesnt support hardwired mesh. Currently i set up 2 of the 3 in bridge mode, it works, nice coverage and best speed i ever saw.\nBut it lacks literally EVERYTHING you need if you want some advanced network stuff like port forwarding. If you dont route all your traffic over gwifi, you cant reach WLAN -> LAN or LAN -> WLAN (so you cant connect to your e.g. babycameras via mobile) or cant reach your wlan printer (srsly!).\nI think they will patch this all eventually, now some will come and say: you suck blabla I just say: I currently use 2 different routers from 2 different ISPs and then i add another router which does the Load Balancing -> it all works flawlessly (!) I have 3 different subnets and they all can reach each other. So its technially possible, but google doesnt seem to care.\nLets see if they fix this, than its the best wlan in the world.."

I have struggled through three different wi-fi routers and multiple repeaters over the past few years trying to get even coverage to no avail. Enter the Google Wifi system (Set of 3) which did the trick immediately. 175 Mbps near the hub and 110 Mbps at the back of the house in the middle of the day (our internet package claims speeds up to 250 Mbps however, unless you are on at 2 am, 170 to 190 is about the best you are going to get). 10 minutes to set up. No fuss and no problems so far. Will update if anything comes up.\nBottom line: If you are looking for wi-fi that simply works I highly recommend this mesh system."

     "comments": "We have a pretty big house, not just in square footage but in the unusual way it is laid out. Before I had two routers with different SSIDs which was a pain and never worked great. Once I got the Google Wifi set up it was fantastic. The one thing to be sure of is that everything in your network is downstream of the device that is acting as the router, i.e. the one attached to your cable/dsl. Once I figured this out things could not be better. Devices switch from one to the other seamlessly so I basically always have maximum strength. I have wired internet so I am able to use that for the backhaul so I don't know how it would be without that, but withit things are very fast."

     "comments": "Bought one officially from Google Store and setup was a breeze, the GUI for management is very sleek and everything you need is at least 3 taps away. I bought this one for my dorm as the provided wireless network could only push out 40Mbps on a good day and other times would just flat out refuse to work so I decided to purchase this and use the provided wired Ethernet connection to use as the uplink.\nIncluded is a speedtest screenshot and a picture of the device sitting on the desk. The brightness is turned all the way up and very pretty to look at. Even after 24 hours of operation it only is slightly warm on the bottom half of the device but not burning hot. Data transfers from devices connected to the device was incredible with an unprecedented 38MB/s (304 Mbps) from a wireless client to a device attached to the LAN gigabit port on the device.\nFor everything this device has done right it isn't however without some flaws. The first thing I noticed was there was no way for you to set your own local LAN IP address subnet and it's locked at 192.168.86.x which granted for a small home network or even for someone who isn't into digging into the nitty gritty with their network it isn't that big of an issue but for me I'm hoping we get the feature in the coming updates. The second issue is the lack of a web interface for which to manage the device from. I understand that in this day and age if you don't have some sort of smartphone device you're most likely living under a rock but having the ability to do so really helps in decreasing the heavy dependence on such devices. I didn't remove a star because even though those features are missing it hasn't affected my utilization and use of the device.\nThe fact that the devices are protected with TPS and will only run Google-signed software its at least a peace of mind that nobody is going to hijack your devices in the middle of the night and is the first devices I have used to actually have that feature. The dual broadcast SSID on both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands is a blessing since you don't have to worry about which wireless network you're connected to at a given time and it will automatically switch to whichever one your device supports and is in optimal range to utilize.\nUltimately though until they allow you to specify your LAN network I would not recommend this where you need more than a /24 (253 usable addresses) on your wireless network. For everything else, absolutely."

     "comments": "Set up was extremely easy. I have an older smart TV and when I upgraded my wireless router a couple of years ago my TV would not recognize it so my TV was no longer smart. With this mesh system I placed one of the units near my TV and connected them using an ethernet cable. Now my smart TV is smart again.\nThe only criticism that I have is about the ethernet cable that is included to connect one unit to the modem. There is no writing on the cable so I am not sure what CAT type it is supposed to be. I have gigabit internet and when I did my first speed test my download speed was only 350MBS. Thought perhaps that I had just spent a lot of money on a mesh system that was not going to meet my needs. Then I replaced the cable that Google provided with a CAT6 cable and my download speed was 940MBS. Either the included cable is junk or mine was defective."

     "comments": "This product is awful I came to expect more from google. The huge issue is the inability to use both bridge mode and mesh networks. That is a very basic needed option. They also do not work in mixed wired/wireless modes. The three pack would be ideal as 2 for inside a modest house with a third covering an outbuilding but again mesh doesn't work when more than one device is wired. This means all devices can only talk to each other wireless. This means it will not work if signal doesn't travel well through your upstairs/downstairs which is the point of buying devices like these.\nI would recommend ubnt's unifi for power users and AmpliFi for anyone that wants a simple to use product."

The TV I'm using it with is already a smart TV, but my TV doesn't have a Sling app. I also like Netflix app on Roku better than on my TV. Overall, Roku loads faster than the smart hub on my TV.\nPros:\n- Very easy installation\n- Easy to use, nice interface. It's great to have Netflix and Sling buttons right on the remote.\n- It's powered from the USB port in my TV, so it's on as soon as I turn on the TV\n- There's also a Roku app that you can download to your phone and use it as a remote. Comes in very handy when you're looking for movies/channels and need to type in the stuff you're searching for\nCons:\n- The only thing I didn't like so far was the fact that you have to provide credit card info when activating Roku - my intent was to use Roku with the services I'm already subscribed to. However, there's a workaround for this, just google it."

     "comments": "OK here are the pros and cons versus the Roku Stick.\nCons: the remote is IR so you need to have line of sight to your tv - really not a big deal - you can easily mount the roku on top of your tv or monitor. The biggest negative is that you can't seem to cast to it from phones/PC's. I've tried everything including 3rd party apps - I just don't think it's supported at all (the Roku stick has an 'enable screen mirroring' option in the setttings...the Express does not). Not a huge deal for me - there's a channel for pretty much everything I want to watch.\nPros: well, price obviously. But the feature I like most is if you use the Roku app on your phone, you can send the audio from the Roku to the phone - so if your TV/monitor is far from you, it's like having a wireless speaker (also great for using headphones). This feature isn't supported on my older Roku sticks - I don't know if the newer versions support it.\nGreat little device at a great price - I love it."

I went from using a Sony Blue Ray player which was the best at the time, but it often stopped streaming right in the middle of a show or movie I was watching. A friend of mine who works in the A/V and custom home theater business recommended I switch to Roku. He was right...fast streaming with no interruptions. I've only been using it for a couple of weeks so I haven't explored the other options and channels available yet. I understand it's great with Amazon Prime video, too, and I guess I'll sign up for that soon."

     "comments": "I'm considering subscribing to some streaming services, and I don't have much money to spend on entertainment, so the Roku Stick 3600R seemed like the way to go. It plugs into your television's HDMI port, pairs with its remote, you register on Roku's web site, and you are good to go. You can install whatever channels you like from Roku's selection, sign into those that require a subscription, or just watch free channels. Set-up is simple. I recommend watching the instructional video on Roku's web site. The only hitch I encountered was that the remote would not pair with the Roku at first. In this case, unplug the Roku from its power source, take the batteries out of the remote, plug the Roku back in, and reinstall the batteries, in that order. Then it will pair.\nThe Roku Stick is 3 1/4\"L x 3/4\"W x 3/8\"D. It sticks out 2 7/8\" when plugged into an HDMI port. If your television does not allow that much space, Roku will send you a free 4-inch flexible extender, which you can request on their web site. You will need the serial number to request an extender. Roku ships them out quickly. When you buy the Stick, a remote control and a power cord that can be plugged into a USB port or into a AC outlet are included. Roku recommends plugging the Stick into an AC outlet, if possible, for a more consistent power source. The remote requires two AAA batteries, also included. You can also control the Roku using their free app for iOS or Android. My internet connection offers only 5-6 Mbps download speed, but this is sufficient for streaming.\nI don't have any paid subscription channels, so I'll comment on the free offerings. For free movies and old TV shows, the choices are Crackle, Popcornflix, FilmRise, and Tubitv. Most selections are in the B-movie category, but there are some gems. The biggest frustration is the lack of ability to search across multiple free channels, if I'm looking for something particular. You can search across the major pay channels. If you want news channels, they are there, but most content is prerecorded. If you can't get international news like Al Jazeera English, RT, France 24 over the air, watching them on Roku is an option, but, again, they are prerecorded clips. There is some nice specialty content, like Poker Central, but most free channels consist of relatively short pre-recorded material.\nThe single technical problem I have with the Roku is that it interferes with my television's over-air antenna. I see this problem mentioned from time to time on the Roku forum. It is probably due to the antenna cable being insufficiently shielded. Mine is not shielded at all, in fact. But I cannot get the local CBS affiliate with the Roku plugged in, and I have sporadic problems with multiple PBS stations in my area. The only solution is to unplug the Roku Stick from both the power source and the television. This is a nuisance. Some people who use antennae are affected, while some are not. It seems to depend, not only on the cable's shielding, but on proximity to a station's broadcast tower and probably the position of the Roku relative to the antenna.\nBy the way, the Roku Streaming Stick 3600R and 3600RW are the same device. The 3600RW is a product offered by Walmart that is co-branded with Vudu. It has a Vudu button on the remote instead of a Google Play button, and it comes with a $5 Vudu coupon. That is the only difference. I like my Roku Stick, but its value is going to depend on whether you need it to stream channels you are paying for or, if not, how much value you find in the free channels and whether or not it interferes with your antenna, if you don't have cable. Assuming the Roku Stick lasts a few years, I think it will be a reasonable value just for the free channels. But that's not a given, which may be surprising, considering the number of channels available."

     "comments": "The Netgear AC2300 Nighthawk is one of the best medium to high end consumer routers out there. It is easy to set up while at the same time offering plenty of advanced features for more technically-included folks, including the ability to install DD-WRT if you really want to geek out. For less technically inclined folks, setup is easy, with a wizard walking you though all the basic configuration options, including the all important configuration of the wireless networks.\nPerformance is excellent; the Wi-Fi easily covered the entire main floor of our home and handled all the wireless devices we threw at it. This isn't magic; normal sources of interference will still cause issues, but for modern devices that can take advantage of the multiple antennas you will likely see a speed increase. I set up the 2.4 ghz radio to be legacy, for older devices, and set the 5 ghz to be the latest and greatest for my newer devices, and this seems to have worked well.\nThere's not too many downsides to the router; I wish it has more Ethernet ports, but all routers in this class seem to stick with four so not a big deal. The design also takes up a bit of space, but given the performance this isn't a big deal.\nAll in all, a great mid to high end router at a competitive price."

     "comments": "This router gives wider coverage than my previous router. I won't give the brand name of that one because it was less expensive and not a direct comparison. What is worth mentioning is that if you spend more you'll get something better and that's usually the case. I didn't see the need of going to a more expensive router than this because the ability to link more devices than what this one is capable of is not a feature I need. We have tablets and phones and a laptop connected wireless, other devices are wired. The Netgear Nighthawk covers both levels of our house (3400sq.ft. combined) and gives a usable signal outdoors for about a hundred feet around the house. We don't have any metal siding or foil coated sheathing on the house which would obstruct the signal. It's installed above ground level, not in the basement. You can download a manual from the Netgear web site that will describe the feature set."

Given this, it's hard not to recommend simply staying away from the entire product line as you have no real way to determine the lemons from the possible good devices.\nA search on google for this router's model and \"dropping wi-fi\" will lead you to results that clearly illustrate that this device has a serious problem with randomly dropping your wi-fi signal. My laptop maintains my wi-fi at work where we have a cheap < $50 access point. I got this router for my home in hopes that it would be faster and more stable than my previous router. Sadly, after about 2 months I started to notice that this thing will drop your wi-fi at least once an hour if not more frequently than that. I have since had to connect via an Ethernet cable when I am working at my desk, but this doesn't help when trying to stream video to the TV. In any case, I doubt I will be giving Netgear another chance. Do yourself a favor and buy a different brand."

Only problem with this distance is Wifi thieves, and I was having that problem. But I stopped him form doing it anymore, with this router you can go to the website and block all new devices from connecting to the wifi. Very Nice. Since I blocked all new devices I haven't had any problems with those low-life wifi thieves."

Several devices, both on 2.4 as well as 5 frequencies, would show the SSIDs as available, but there would be no internet connection. I have tried changing the settings according to Netgear articles. I updated the firmware to the latest. I used WiFi analyzer to find the least used channels in my vicinity. The router is still periodically dropping WiFi, which makes tasks like gaming very aggravating. The wired Ethernet connections have always been perfect. In fact, I was streaming movies on the TV via a wired Roku, and while the WiFi dropped, the streams kept going 100%. So, I know the issue is not with my ISP or cable modem.\nNetgear's customer service scheduled a phone appointment with me, and didn't call me. Then tried rescheduling the call the next day. This was frustrating as well. Thought they would just give me a number to call right away."

Unlike nearly every other AP, router etc, it CANNOT be accessed directly through a GUI. To make matters worse, the Controller would not start for us on Win 7. The locator software found the device, but it could never be accessed.\nAfter Googling this problem and seeing how many people were dealing with the same issue -- with causes ranging from: conflicting ports, to wrong Java script versions, to default install directory problems (software doesn't even allow you decide the install path, then puts itself in a Linux/Unix-like dir structure that appears to create problems for Windows), and more -- I have decided to return the unit. Setting up an AP should never be this complicated."

     "comments": "I recently bought this and have only had it for a few days (time of writing obviously) but so far it has been a real eye opener. This is from someone that normally would buy your typical mid-high end wireless home routers from ASUS, ASROCK, TP-LINK etc..\nNow, I am no Network Engineer and/or IT Specialist but I am what can be considered a \"prosumer\" or \"power-user\". I know plenty of advanced topics and concepts in networking but in no way to the deep level understanding that a professional Network or IT engineer would. That said, I've only had it a few days and being a relatively simple product (in terms of what its main purpose is) I will go over the main differences \"I\" noticed when moving to an AP + Gateway/Router + Modem HOME solution instead of the typically Wireless Router + Modem only solution.\nThe first thing you will immediately notice is that this is NOT going to be plug n play like a wireless router would. Now, that is not to say that this is a pain to setup but just FYI this will require at least a bit of effort besides hooking up Ethernet cable(s) and applying power. Now, as a prosumer I like tinkering and what not so this is fine by me. Honestly, the most time-consuming part of this process is mounting it. Actually setting it up software wise is extremely easy. The inevitable question will come up...do I have to mount it on the ceiling/wall? NO you do not. It can be just sitting somewhere on a flat surface if you wish but obviously its not recommended not because it won't work but because wireless coverage/throughput won't be at its best and if your spending this much to upgrade your home wireless network you might as well go the extra mile and get everything you can out of it.\nThe software you literally just follow the instructions, download the controller software to a PC/Laptop/HomeServer ect... and execute. The software is intuitive and you will pick up on the GUI quickly with simple exploration/discovery. It handles the initialization, configuration & monitoring of the AP.\nNow for the impressions. MASSIVE difference compared to having a singular Wireless Router powering your whole house/apartment. In my case, I have about an ~1200 sqft apartment. I mounted it on the ceiling near the center of the apartment in the most open area (Living Room + Dining Room + Kitchen) and used a 50ft CAT5e shielded UTP Ethernet cable to neatly route it back to my now WIRED only router (If you are staying with a wireless router, disable ALL radios) + POE Switch Combo. My whole apartment is literally covered with \"Full Bars\" of coverage. The lowest point I could find was way back in the Master Bedroom where it was a good -62 dBm (Anything above -65 dBm is good IMO). Before, I could not go to my Bedroom without experiencing intermittent drops and/or LAG. Not to mention that when I did have a connection there it was sometimes slow, as in Youtube constantly buffering slow. This is no longer the case and I am really impressed. The Controller software also has some pretty advanced features which I like and the interface and how it shows you stats and data is really neat and slick. The LED Blue light CAN be turned off if you wish.\nOverall, really satisfied and will no longer rely on wireless routers or all-in-one solutions again. Honestly, although it is more work, it is far worth it to avoid hassling with the router and the frustration of dealing with slow internet when you KNOW you are paying for high speed internet (In my case its 200 Down, 20 Up) and are not getting those results. Now granted, this is wireless we are talking about so you will RARELY get your full internet speed if your roaming around or not in line of sight of the AP. In my case, If I am in the living room or anywhere within line of sight and maybe 20-40 ft away It will get pretty close sometimes even full speed (Average I'd say 170-180 mbps out of 200 Max). Anywhere not line of sight and an appreciable distance away will drop it to an average of 90-120 mbps which is STILL EXCELLENT compared to my previous numbers of 5-10!! This is on both the 2.4 GHZ and 5 GHZ bands as well as using an AC device (Galaxy S Phone).\nIf your case is similar to mine and don't mind tinkering, DITCH the wireless router and get a good Wired Router/Gateway because those have much better hardware for handling plenty of traffic since they don't worry about radios. BUY this AP because of its easy and slick GUI AND the fact that the company Ubiquiti has other products that have similar design style and will integrate nicely together with ONE software package (Big deal for me maybe not for others). Highly Recommended!"

My old Wireless Access Point was solid (always a good connection) but I wanted an upgrade that supported current standards. Although I was accustom to Enterprise APs that we installed at the University, because of cost I first tried a Consumer grade AP from a commonly known vender. The wireless signal would drop out often so I returned it. I then discovered and purchased Ubiquiti AP and have been very pleased. No dropping of signal and I have complete coverage in my two story home.\nPro:\n- The AP supports PoE (Power over Ethernet), comes with an injector to send power to the unit. This let me install the AP in the ceiling of my second floor home\n- The controller software is free to download and runs in Windows or Mac OS\n- Looks and performs like an Enterprise AP (Cisco) but no licensing.\n- Supports current technology\nCon:\n- Some learning curve may be required if not familiar with the technology terms"

     "comments": "No matter what I tried, I couldn't get the Java controller app to work, it would just hang forever, saying \"Starting UniFi Controller...\" This access point is not managed through a browser on Windows 10, you have to install Java and run a special Java app (an app that didn't work). Also, not all the advertised features of the AP work unless you constantly run the app somewhere, like as a background Windows service, which you have to configure yourself on some other machine that must always be running or install some kind of \"Cloud Key\" (read the docs). Also, it seems that this AP often talks to the manufacturer's web site (search the Internet to see others talking about it), so, what if you block all Internet traffic to/from the AP at the perimeter, are there other features that will stop working then? Is it spying for marketing reasons? Who knows...but it's not worth the hassle, I'm returning it, and have already ordered a different AP. Kudos to Amazon for making returns easy."

     "comments": "Awesome WAP with tons of features and great performance. I have deployed many different business class wireless access points with a variety of customer needs and expectations. These units consistently outperform most others, especially when considering cost and features. Ubiquiti's Unifi platform is similar to Cisco's Meraki platform in which you can manage these units from the cloud. With that being said Unifi is not quite at the level of Meraki, but they sure are close! The performance you get out these is amazing considered their price. With the Unifi controller software you can manage them locally, or remotely if you decide to use their cloud key. The cloud key is a device that you plug into your switch that runs a version of the Unifi controller software. You can then link that to your Unifi cloud account for remote access. This is particularly helpful if you are not geographically close to the install location.\nOnce you have the Unifi controller software setup, either on a local computer, or the cloud key, you can search for and add each Unifi device to your network. There is also a google chrome extension that will scan your network to help you find them. I recommend setting each device with a static IP in order to make them easier to find later.\nOverall great wireless access points! I have yet to be let down by Ubiquiti and will continue to highly recommend them."

After struggling with every brand of commercial routers for 15 years trying to keep my 3 story home with up to 20 wifi devices and 6 people happy, I have success.\nI started with the 3 pack of BGN AP's and it was transformational. I got maximum bandwidth on every floor and have yet to have an AP fail, boot, or stop handling traffic unless I asked for it to do so. Today I aded the ProAC Dual-Radio unit to the mix to get a bit better bandwidth in the main section of the house and to repurpose one of the lesser units to the garage for better outdoor coverage. The new unit is an order of magnitude faster and was adopted and provisioned in probably 1/3 the time of the older units. That isn't so much a problem as it is a statement of the improvement.\nAnd did I mention bandwidth? Pretty much every iPhone, iPad, laptop and Kindle within connection range of the new AP is pulling over 90Mbps when my max Internet bandwidth is 105.\nFor the small investment in time and effort to learn the difference between a router and an Access Point you will not be disappointed."

     "comments": "Just fired this thing up and so far I like it. Devices connect quickly. Can be a little confusing for the uninitiated to configure and the management interface doesn't help much. The interface could use some work to be more user friendly, but otherwise does the job. Part of the possible confusion is that the management interface is designed to manage multiple devices (APs, switches, etc), which isn't a bad thing if you need this capability, but can confuse users that haven't dealt with this sort of management capability in the past. If I had one complaint it would be that the UniFi Controller sofware frequently errors with a failed to initialize message if left running idle. Restarting it fixes the problem, but it is annoying.\nThis is a PoE only device, so you must use a PoE injector or PoE switch if installing it. Fortunately the single pack comes with a PoE injector. The power cord on the injector could be longer (its about 24 inches), but this is not a show stopper. Also nice is the secondary Ethernet port for bridging with another AP.\nConnection speeds have been good and my phone had no problem connecting to the 5G radio automatically (something that was a chore with the LinkSys AC wireless router I've been using."

     "comments": "I am so glad I bought this over the rival product I was considering. My aging DIR-655 which was only 802.11n 2.4GHz only was crashing every so often. While that wasn't catastrophic because I was only using it for 2.4GHz WiFi and not routing (I have my own router that I will not give up, ever). I also needed to supplement this with a cheap $20 802.11ac upgrade mini AP. But this AP had certain limitations that made it just an interesting gimmick. Being 802.11ac, it was capable of speeds in excess of 100Mbps under ideal circumstances, but it's single ethernet uplink port being Fast Ethernet only (100Mbps) made it cap out wireless speeds in total to just under 100Mbps. Also it was 5GHz only, so only my most expensive or more recent devices could use it (but that was ok, because I bought it mostly for my phone and my wife's phone). But being \"mini\" it's builtin antennae had horrible range (on top of the already known limited range of 5GHz compared to 2.4GHz). So while when the main WiFi crashed, my Internet was still usable to the wired devices and my phone, it got annoying that the kids constantly asked me why I shut the WiFi off, when I hadn't.\nSo I started looking into replacing both units for a single newer, faster, and more reliable unit. I had worked with much older (802.11g only) versions of these several years ago at a job where they bought some upon recommendations a coworker and I had made. While I was not the one who ended up setting them up I was pleased with the overall operation and range. So naturally I've always remained interested in them, but they were always too expensive for me to justify buying them for personal use.\nBut now a friend recommended Google WiFi, which did a similar 3 AP setup. I also liked that I could just buy one. But then I realized I could buy just 1 of the Ubiquiti Unifi. And both turned out to be 802.11b/g/n/a/ac. And both were priced the same (within a $1 of each other when I bought this). Though the Google WiFi claimed a SUBSTANTIALLY higher range than the Ubiquiti Unifi (though that claim was also WAY higher than many other wireless routers that were believable so it was immediately suspect). I read many recent reviews that did say the Google WiFi had awesome range (though nothing likely close to the 3x difference compared to this unit). But one thing the reviews all agreed upon is that despite the range, it was NOT the fastest wireless single they tested in a group of mesh systems.\nWhat killed it for me was when I did more research it came out that the Google WiFi systems are actually a router and while it is capable of being put into what they call \"bridged\" mode, where it essentially behaves just as a regular Access Point only WiFi device with no routing functionality... You end up loosing most of the cool functionality they show in the videos. That made it pointless, as being a Systems Engineer by profession, I demand more control of my systems. There was also the uncool tendency of Google just abandoning a project they feel isn't worth it anymore for them (either it's not making them any money or who knows, maybe they just lost interest). While I've had a great experience with my two (1 first gen, 2nd newer) Chromecast, I've had other Google products that become fundamentally defunct due to Google choosing to no longer support them way before I feel I am done with the device. And something like my WiFi I typically buy and it gets used for 5 years or so, I wasn't comfortable with the very real possibility of Google abandoning it just because THEY felt it was too old, before I felt the same way.\nSo I pulled the trigger and bought one of these instead of the Google WiFi. After receiving it and setting it up, I have to say I couldn't be happier. Google WiFi may be a great product, but I feel it's more for the typical \"hipster\" masses than for an Engineer like me. I will definitely say that while the Ubiquiti Unifi isn't enterprise Cisco type of complexity to setup, but it is definitely more advanced than your average person who doesn't consider themselves computer savvy. While this does require software to setup and run these APs, it is different in that it runs more as a server software that can be made to run all the time to control these. However, it gives you the flexibility to install this anywhere you want, so you don't have to have it installed as a piece of server software on your desktop, and maybe install it on a file server you may have on your network if you prefer (I'm thinking of doing it on a raspberry Pi myself). Also the software doesn't need to be running all the time for the AP to function, just to make changes, or do monitoring of the APs. So for now I just fire it up when I need to make a change.\nRange. I don't know if the Google WiFi would have really blown this thing out of the water, but all I can say is, for me, for what I wanted, this thing gets 5 stars in range, definitely better than my previous setup. I get signal throughout my whole 1100sqft apartment.\nSpeed. I finally get the full speed of my 150+Mbps Internet connection even from a room or two away on the WiFi!!! That previously required a wired connection to do! 5 stars here again. I am definitely impressed at this point.\nConfiguration options. Again, this thing is in between enterprise and home office, definitely more advanced than the typical unit, but not so daunting that I believe even tech savvy types could easily figure out most things. If you don't understand computers much, then yes, this is not for you. It has plenty of options, and flexibility in how you set it up, that it empowers you to set your network up as you see fit to fit YOUR needs. Not what most companies believe you do with your computers/devices.\nIn the end I literally have ZERO complaints about this thing. I am super ecstatic I went with this instead of something else possibly even more expensive offering functionality I didn't even really need. More than highly recommended if you really just need a good high quality Access Point."

It was placed about 20 feet from the router in the kitchen. Service was usually ok in the living room (next to the kitchen), but rarley worked upstairs, especially in the rooms farthest from the router and extender. I was also constantly going into settings on my iPhone and iPad to get the \"best\" signal as extenders are \"separate\" from the main router. It did not work for my needs and would not recommend you purchase. Mesh networks are now available and recommend if you have the money to go with an Amplifi HD or Netgear Orbi, especially if you have a larger home and do not want or need direct Ethernet ports."

ATT discounted my internet so it did not go up in price since I have my cell phones through them. So it is worth it in one month!\nCons\nNavigation is still a little odd. I have to do multiple clicks to get my shows I tag... that should be the first thing I see.\nI also get a little confused about what I have new episodes in and what I do not until I drill in to the show page\nSome things come up right away, others like \"The Bachelor\" come up days or a week later which ticked my wife off a bit. ;)\nThe remote does nothing to control TV volume. Had to purchase a sideclick to assist with that."

You will need to go into your router setting and adjust 5Ghz from 80hz to 40hz. Super easy to do, and once done you can enjoy the speed you bought this thing for. if don't then you are only using standard N speeds and bandwidth. The upgraded iphone functionality is a nice feature.from the Roku 3."

     "comments": "Last update 4-5-2017: After going back and forth between Roku and Rovio aka Angry Birds on my issue , (I was told to contact Rovio as Roku could not do anything) I received this sad email from Rovio:\nApr 5, 18:04 EEST\nHello there,\nthank you for reaching out to us. Unfortunately, we have ended the distribution of our games on Roku platform on the 31st of August 2014. As a result, our games are no longer available on Roku. We hope you get a chance to play the games on another platform.\nAs long as you have those games installed, they will remain available for you to play, but they can no longer be purchased. We apologize for the inconvenience caused and hope this clarifies things.\nBest regards,\nTadeusz\nRovio Support Team\n*** So folks, if you still have a working Roku 2 XS or a Roku 3, keep those as all the Angry Birds games work on them. EVEN if you paid for these Angry Birds games, they will NOT carry over to the NEW Roku models even though all the other games you may have purchased for the Roku 2XS or Roku 3 carry over to the NEW Roku models (as mine have) just NOT the Angry Birds games that you got for FREE or purchased. *** I tried.. for my son with Autism, and hoping for LESS clutter. Good thing I still own 4 Roku 2XS's!\nUPDATE 4/4/2017:\nAfter a lot of research, I found out that the Angry Birds Game license with ROKU has expired and this game is only found on the original Roku 2XS models now. After further research, I found that I can add a vanity code and PURCHASE Angry Birds Rio and Angry Birds Seasons for $4.99 each. Which I did today. However, these 2 Angry Birds games I purchased (like others I have bought) only show up on my ROKU 2 XS's and not on my Roku Premier + or my Roku Ultra. Very frustrating because the past games I have purchased for my Roku 2XS's all show up on the new Roku Models, but not the Angry Birds Rio or Angry Birds Seasons. **knocking off another star!**\n-----\nI own 4 Roku 2XS (since 2013) and they've worked great up until Dec. 2016, when now watching a video via Amazon Prime or Youtube or SlingTV, they all now RE-BOOT within 60 minutes when they never had a problem prior to Dec 2016. No fix for this strange problem and it coincidentally seems maybe Roku is forcing us to buy the NEWER models? Regardless, I plunged in and bought 2 replacements for 2 of my Roku 2 XS's.\nOne the Roku Premier+ and the other a Roku Ultra both via Amazon. Both work great (so far) while watching movies for over 60 minutes, but my only BIG GRIPE is they have taken away the basic ANGRY BIRDS GAME (offered free with the ROKU 2XS) It is not offered free or for purchase at all on the newer ROKU Models! Sure they have the other games we've purchased with the Roku 2XS's now brought over to my new ROKU models as well as some other games for free and for purchase, but my problem is the NEW ROKU MODELS are missing the ANGRY BIRDS GAME. It is just not there for us now. The NEW ROKU models are very capable of handling the basic Angry Birds Game. So why isn't it offered?\nMy one 13 yr old twin son has Autism. HE LOVES this game! He plays it alone, and the best part is that he PLAYS WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS with this awesome game. I've messaged ROKU via Facebook how this very simple fun family game should be brought back to the NEWER ROKU Models. If the old Roku 2XS's can handle the Angry Birds game, certainly the new Roku Models can.\nI can't post my petition link on this issue here with my Amazon review, but maybe others out there can contact ROKU about bringing the Angry Birds Game back to the new ROKU models via email, twitter, or FB on this issue that would be great!\nIf Roku brings back this FUN FAMILY GAME (even if I have to purchase it) , I will raise my rating stars to 5."

I tried web sites, instructions in the Roku box, etc. I had a minor problem==fixed it myself finally. But could have saved myself a whole lot of time by talking to an \"expert\" at Roku. It is quite obvious to me they were not interested in me as a customer, but more about saving money by not having someone available by phone to assist you. Next time I am going to review more closely other devices doing the same task as this Roku and remember this experience. If your phone number is published somewhere, I am taking a Donald Trump. No apology, it should have been easier to find!"

Now I only use Roku as it supports virtually any channel while I found that Google Chromecast wasn't ideal as it was great from casting but not streaming unless you used a tablet or smartphone. While I've been a Apple products user for many decades, I found that Apple TV didn't allow for Amazon, a competitor, as well as some other channels. Roku allows you to have far more channels than you can ever imagine plus you can also add what they call Private Channels, not necessarily porn, but other channels that aren't listed in their control box."

That's the end of the improvements over the Roku3. As MANY other people have posted, there is a terrible audio syncing issue with this device. Netflix seems ok, but Plex is unwatchable. I've tried connecting the roku directly to the TV and I've tried connecting it through my Yamaha receiver. The audio is out of sync on the same videos and by the same amount of time for both methods. I've tried changing the audio settings in the roku as well as my receiver; some settings work better than others but none of them are acceptable. Movies with DTS audio are the by far the worst. The audio plays about 1 second ahead of the video. Dolby and DTS-MA are both a little out of sync. This is unusable.\nI can play netflix and plex through my TV's apps and the same programs all play perfect, so it's not source videos. I wanted the roku because the plex app has additional functions not available through my tv's version of the app. I'll wait a little bit for an answer, but this thing is going to be returned."

     "comments": "The good:\nIt does what it is supposed to do. Overall no better or worse than any other device of the same kind. If you are looking for a device to access your Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Prime stuff this will do it fine.\nThe bad:\nIf you are a person that does not care about privacy or being forced to do things then there is no bad. However if you, like me, care about privacy and don't like being forced to do things then you won't like it.\n1. You HAVE to sign up for a Roku account. You cannot access the device if you do not.\nI don't see why I need a Roku account to access my Netflix account. I don't need a Samsung account to use my Samsung bluray player that also allows me to access my Netflix account. The Roku box is just a door stop if you don't sign up for a Roku account.\n2. You are forced to enter a credit card in order to get a Roku account.\nWhy? If I have no intention of buying anything through Roku why do then need to have my CC number? If I am only using it to access other third party apps such as Netflix or Hulu then why does Roku need my CC info?\n3. It needs your phone number to set up a Roku account.\nAgain, why? No other devices needs this info just to use it to access third party stuff.\nSo bottom line is that if you don't mind this stuff then it is OK; no better or worse then other options. Since I do mind this stuff I think I will stick with my Amazon FireTV or my Samsung bkuray player which are not as nosy.\n[True my Amazon FireTV requires stuff but I already have Amazon Prime so they have all that anyway. Likewise if Netflix had a box. But I was hoping that Roku, having no relation to any of these companies would be more like the Samsung box in that it just lets you do stuff without asking anything for itself. So better and perhaps more private than the others. Instead it is even more nosy.]"

Unfortunately, there exists a bug in the current FW which causes the audio to be out of sync when playing DTS audio output to a compatible receiver. Roku has publicly acknowledge the existence of this bug in their forums, but there is currently no ETA on when the fix will arrive. 7.5.1 was supposed to fix the issue, but unfortunately for me it did not.\nUntil this bug is fixed, I am giving this product a 1 star review.\nTL;DR buy a Roku 3 or 4. They are rock solid, this and the ultra are not."

Do NOT purchase this unless and until Arris and Intel have provided the firmware upgrade to your ISP and/or your ISP has verified to you that the firmware upgrade has been pushed out for this model. The SB 6183 has been tested and does not have this issue. If you're a gamer, latency is not a good thing. Do your homework on this purchase! This applies to ANY make/model that utilizes the Intel Puma6 processor/chipset. Go with something that is Broadcom based to avoid this.

After hooking it up and getting it activated with my cable company, I quickly found that the only speeds that are as advertised, are the hardwire speeds only. The Wi-Fi completely sucks.

I have gotten 123 out of it once. On average don't expect to get more than 25 megs on wifi. Had I known that I wouldn't get my full speed I would have never bought in this product. Do not buy this if you want your Wi-Fi To work properly. I would've continue to pay the monthly service for my cable companies modem had I known that this modem with suck this bad. I never had an issue with Wi-Fi with my other modem. I would highly recommend staying with what you have with your current cable company if you want your Wi-Fi speeds to be as they are now.

I called Arris support and their solution is to blame the cable company. My solution: buy a crappy $25 router, which is working perfectly for streaming, downloading, etc. My suggestion: do your research and thoroughly test this very expensive paperweight so you can return it when your devices start dropping the wifi connection."

     "comments": "This router was working gorgeously for about a year and two months for me. I purposely purchased this router, which was fairly expensive at the time, because I wanted a router that would be able to broadcast a strong WIFI signal throughout my 2-story house. Simply: I was looking for quality. If you had asked me what I thought about this router anytime within the first year and two months of using it, I would have said \"great, no problems. 5 stars.\"\nSadly, it looks like this product isn't designed to span to 2 years or past that. After a year and two months, the WIFI broadcasting has become dramatically weaker. From my 100+ mbps internet connection (speed confirmed with wired ethernet connections), I will now only receive up to 40 mbps if my wireless device is within 10 feet of the WIFI Router. Once I am 20 feet away, my WIFI speed is reduced down to 4 mbps. Anything beyond 20 feet is drastically slower (think cellular phone 2G speeds) or unusable. At 30 feet away, using my cell phone's internet as a hotspot is significantly faster than the internet speed I would get from the WIFI Router.\nI've tried resetting the router, updating the firmware, changing the settings to default, unplugging it, relocating the router -- just about everything you can imagine. But for whatever reason the router's WIFI speed broadcast has become unusable if you're more than 20 feet away from it.\nI would not recommend this router."

What a difference it made and I'm sorry I didn't do it long before now. The Centurylink unit is in bridge mode now and the TP-Link handles the wi-fi. I get much better connection speed downstairs and no dropouts. My wired speedtest download is 22.8 Mbps through a 20 Mbps service and 22.2 through the wi-fi downstairs in the far corner of the house. I'm quite happy with this purchase."

Regardless, resetting the router multiple times a day should not be a part of anyone's routine. I'd look elsewhere for a good cheap router."

Wifi seems to work great too but I don't use it for gaming.\nThe only problem I have is that I can't seem to get anywhere near 1000 down speeds unless I turn off the spi firewall, I suppose this thing just doesn't have the processing power to route 1000 mpbs with spi enabled: it seems to average no more than 300 mbps up and down with it on."

     "comments": "NOTE: This review is for the TP-Link AC3150 VERSION 2, released 1st QTR 2017.\nThis replaces my nearly three year old Linksys AC1900 router which has been a good performer, but I recently upgraded to 100 Mbps download/10 Mbps upload speeds and wanted to make sure I had a modem with the latest protocols to handle everything smoothly. We are also considering upgrading to the 300/30 tier later in the year, so we wanted to make sure the router could handle that comfortably as well.\nInstallation was quick and painless and it recognized our existing connections. We have several printers, laptops, desktops, tablets, smartphones, and a smart UHD TV connected to the device, and with the exception of the Brother printer which required some reconfiguration, everything is working great. One thing I noticed immediately is Netflix 4K and HD streaming is SO MUCH SMOOTHER, especially when another person is watching 4K videos on YouTube at the same time. With the old Linksys AC1900 router we would always have buffering delays on one or both devices.\nSignal strength on each device is 3 to 5 bars, which is about the same or maybe slightly improved over the old router. We have the router in about the center of our apartment which is fairly long and narrow but not huge, so I'm sure we're not testing the limit of the AC3150's range.\nAmazon still sells the first generation TP-Link AC3150 VERSION 1 (released 1st QTR 2016) TP-Link AC3150 Wireless Wi-Fi Gigabit Router with XStream Processing, NitroQAM, Smart Connect (Archer C3150 V1), and at the time of this review it sells for $50 less than the current model. In this new Version 2 device, TP-Link claims to have made improvements to the MU-MIMO functionality: \"...(it) has been fine-tuned for better performance, providing more than twice the throughput across multiple MU-MIMO devices.\" You will have to decide for yourself if that feature improvement is worth the extra cost.\nFor us the TP-Link AC3150 V2 is a big improvement over our old router. If you have the first generation of the AC3150 I see no compelling reason to upgrade, but if your router is more than a few years old you are likely to see a performance improvement with this new model.\n**** 4 STARS - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! ****"

But whenever we're both on and all the other person is doing is just facebook stalking it'll quit and need a restart. At first it was only every few weeks it might need it but has gotten to a point where it needs to be restarted nearly daily. So overall the speed is a huge upgrade but losing total internet access at random is very frustrating to an online gamer. Not sure what i should do with it as it only has this issue when both of us are online. I'm disappointed with its reliability"

     "comments": "I have had a lot routers over the years. No matter what brand I used there was always some place in the house the signal was poor and connection was intermittent. I was skeptical about the Orbi but read the reviews good and bad. I think the price was a bit too high but decided to give it a try knowing Amazon would take it back if it wasn't going to work for my purposes. My house is approximately 2300 square feet and has lots of walls.\nI purchased Orbi December 10, 2016. I waited to write a review so I could see how Orbi was going to work.\nWhen it arrived the installation went fairly smooth and was easy. Had a little difficulty in updating the satellite's firmware but figured it out and got it done. Once it was up, I have full signal throughout my house including the areas where the signal was poor. Simply amazing.\nWhat I like is that it uses a separate wireless band for connecting the two units. It uses one SSID and chooses the best band for your device that you are connecting. I haven't had any connection issues and has been running great.\nOverall, I would recommend this to anyone but it is pricey. I just hope the unit lasts a long time. I did purchase a warranty just in case."

     "comments": "DISCLAIMER: This is actually a review of Netgear warranty/support, not the product.\nThis system has the same one-year Netgear warranty which covered my 16-month-old Nighthawk X8. It also is/was cutting edge, until it died suddenly last night, which is why I'm looking at replacements. I would have been willing to consider Orbi if it had a longer warranty, but no such luck.\nNetgear DOES NOT EVEN ACCEPT EMAILS for product issues after the warranty expires, it points you at the community and paid support when all I have is a question.\nApologies for appearing to dis the product itself, but I did want to alert customers impressed by its 'wow' specs that a brick is a brick, and dead electronics have no specs, they're just an indication of a bad investment. I'll be looking at other offerings."

     "comments": "I was having problems with my Apple Time Capsule due to the congested 2.4 ghz frequency and the lack of range of the 5 ghz frequency. My speeds were a fraction of what I was paying my ISP for. The Orbi seemed to have solved this problem as I range between 50% and 100% of the speed that is delivered. During the evening, the speed is still only 50%, but this is certainly significantly better than the Time Capsule. Overall, this seems to have done the trick."

Not only do I have full coverage in my house with the orbi, but I am consistently getting my max speed from my provider. If you have wifi woes, I strongly recommend this product."

I have a 3200sqft house that's very long. My home office/internet service is on one end and one of my smart TV's is on the other. The signal speed is only slightly lower on the satellite unit. My internet speed isn't great to begin with, so I as buffering quit a bit streaming you tube or netflix. Now, it works like a champ.\nYes, I know it's a lot of money, but it was worth it to me to solve this issue."

The router is at the far end of the house and the building is 30 yards from the opposite end of the yard.

At the same time, inside the house, my son is streaming online gaming and there is no lag or loss of power. Buy this router. It is well worth the expense."

The ethernet traffic light correctly lights amber and shows traffic, but nothing gets through. This was not revealed in the documentation or advertisement. Calling Netgear support resulted in their blaming Comcast (because they got SNR and dbmv confused from the status page and wouldn't admit it). Even when I explained the problem the blamed Comcast. The direct evidence is that I connected a gigabit computer to a gigabit hub to this modem. It was fine. The I added a 100mpbs device to the hub and everything stopped working, including the gigabit computer. Various other device and cable combinations eliminated other possible sources of failures.\nOutside of that it works well at a good price, but it took a while to debug and the purchase of another router. I'm giving it two stars not for lack of functionality but rather lack of revelation and bad tech support."

For example if my upload or download speeds are out of range. Or if i am only uploading on 1 channel instead of 4. I can just glance at the modem and the light colors will let me know if something is wrong. I do notice that this modem runs much hotter than the Motorola that I replaced.\nSo I would recommend that it is in a very well ventilated place."

My internet speed dropped by 5 mbps from 29 to 24mbps with this modem. Spoke with ISP since they had to provision this modem said it could take an hour or two for my speed to peak near 70 which is what I pay for, never happened. Speed has stayed at 24mbps. A waste of money since no speed increase was achieved and speed actually became slower."

     "comments": "Despite being a network administrator that deals with far more complex wireless, routing, switching, security appliances, etc I don't tend to spend a lot of money for home networking equipment. I want my home network to deliver me the bandwidth package I purchase from my ISP to all my devices, and that's about it. I didn't want to keep the ISP provided wireless/security appliance as many ISP provided systems are now revoking access to assign custom DNS servers via DHCP. Cox, for example, won't allow this change and their DNS servers are SLOW, probably due to being overloaded. A big reason they're doing this is to attempt to prevent people from going with DNS services that block geolocation. Pair that with devices such as a Roku that also won't allow assigning custom DNS servers and you see the problem.\nI'd like a Meraki setup because of advanced functions & VPN to my offices, but didn't want to fork out the cost... I'll probably eventually have my company provide it, but for now I just need a device to provide flexible wireless service from my ISP's modem. Outside of controlling my DNS via DHCP, I really don't need anything advanced at home, so I found a $30 TP-LINK that did just that... but also the wireless throughput was WEAK & inconsistent, despite switching channels & other means to avoid interference. I hopped back on Amazon and found the ASUS, which is a brand of various hardware that I've trusted for years... 12 hours later, it's in the Amazon locker. I get it home, 15 minutes later I have it setup with my preferred DNS with expected signal/throughput. It has far more advanced features that I may eventually tinker with, but for now, it does everything I need with ease."

It's fairly stylish, performance and reliability are excellent for its price, and the included firmware is very feature-rich for a stock firmware. Beware though that as of the time of writing, it doesn't appear to be compatible with third party firmwares such as DD-WRT and Tomato, and the guy who writes the Merlin AsusWRT firmware says it will not be ported to this model. However, I really don't consider this lack of firmware diversity an issue, because it does offer a ton of functionality in the built-in firmware."

     "comments": "I'll start by saying Amazon's customer service on this has been amazing, but the router is faulty out of the box. The last few iterations of Asus firmware has been deeply flawed, frequent WAN disconnects regardless of settings. This router is new and has no Tomato or Merlin alternative supported firmware, so you are stuck with the single one ASUS gives you. Every 5-10 minutes the WAN disconnects for no reason, I've spent hours on the phone with ASUS and reading countless reports of other people online with the same issues with no resolution.\nWhen it works, it's got great range and is very fast. But dropping internet every 10 minutes is unacceptable. I ended up ditching it and buying a TP-Link Archer C7. Avoid at all costs until ASUS gets a stable firmware instead of shipping this garbage."

We decided use it as a wireless extender and we did play around with the configuration way too much not because of this unit. The primary router was big-brother the AC88U. We were constantly losing the 5.0 channel off if it. Had we not been monitoring it we never would have noticed as when the 5.0 dropped on the AC88U (you could not even see the SSID being broadcast) it would fail over to this unit. We were observing devices connected to the weaker signal. If you google AC88U you will real all about 5.0 dropping. It is a problem that you can see on other manufacturers too. After much tweaking we now have a stable connection and bridging."

I don't know what it was about it but I was not getting anywhere near the speeds I should have be getting on my 150 mbps connection. I decided to dump the Nighthawk and try this. I was very skeptical because the ASUS was much cheaper but I tried it anyway. Let me tell you, this thing is a BEAST for the price! The speeds on all the devices in my house are much, MUCH better now. I don't really use it for anything advanced such as backups or plugging in an external drive to stream music or anything so I cannot really give a review on those features. However, it is excellent for basic home networking and internet usage. Very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend to others."

I was using this primarily to transfer video files from SD cards via USB 3.0 card reader, but disconnected so many times I promptly returned for a new hub and haven't had a single disconnect! While the blue LED's looked cool, it was NOT worth the absolute lack of functionality."

I bought this for my PS4 but unfortunately, it didn't work properly. I tried it on both ports but but still the same problem. I just wanted to connect the PS headset bluetooth stick and a 16GB Memory Stick. The memory seemed to work alright when saving the game data but my headset barely get the signal from the stick when connected to the hub. I cannot even move my head or the sound goes off. It's like the power from the hub is not enough to feed even a little bluetooth stick?... I just had to take it off since I always play with my ps headsets on. I also have an external hard drive permanently connected in the other port but even though the power light flashes as it normally does; when trying to play an storaged game it says that no hard drive is connected to the ps4 when connected to the hub. Just be aware... I really haven't tried with my computer to see what happens...."

Now, I see other buyers have had similar problems.\nMy other criticism is that the hub comes with a 30-inch cable with a USB 3.0 Micro-B connector that seems flimsy compared to the more popular USB B Male connectors used by other manufacturers. And the 30-inch cable was too short to run from my PC under my desk to the hub on top of the desk."

Despite following all instructions and spending several hours over 2 days, I could never get this router to connect to the internet. If you browse the other 1-star reviews, you'll see that this is a common problem.\nI returned this router, and on the advice of a salesperson at a local electronics store, I purchased a Netgear router. Although I had some similar problems connecting at first, the key difference was the Netgear \"Genie,\" software provided by Netgear that solved the connection problems and made the needed adjustments in the Ethernet and WiFi settings on my computer.\nUnless you are EXTREMELY conversant with setting up a WiFi router, I would avoid TP-link products. Although they have software that is supposed to aid in set up, I could never get it to work properly or even save my settings! I recommend Netgear -- the Genie will save you a lot of headaches!"

     "comments": "I take one-star Amazon reviews with a grain of salt, especially with something like wireless routers where there's a ton of factors that can go wrong (environment, user error, etc). I had a TP-Link router prior to this that had its WiFi die after about four years, but was otherwise solid. I have used some other TP-Link networking products with no issues, so I had no qualms trying out this router.\nThe wireless range and speed of this router were vastly improved over my old one. Really impressive, I could pull down good speeds all over my house. The admin interface was fairly intuitive. Great. Wired performance has been solid, and remains so.\nA few weeks later I started getting some reliability problems with the WiFi. I tried lots of different settings tweaks - separated out the 5G with a different SSID which possibly helped, and I made sure the firmware was up-to-date. All the usual suspects. I go through with a SSID scanner to make sure I'm not trying to share the same channel as my neighbors. Everything seems okay.\nAbout 2-3 weeks later (after the return window), we start getting the problem that is described in pretty much EVERY 1-star review: The WiFi will show up to devices, but is impossible to wirelessly connect to the router. (E.g., your SSID will show up on your computer with four bars, but your computer can't connect to it) Rebooting the router fixes it (usually). Needless to say, I am less than impressed with a box I have to reset every other day to get it to work correctly.\nThis problem is more and more frequent, and I decided to replace the router last week. This week I've finally started to see the other problem mentioned in the 1-star reviews: Reboots send me back to factory settings (including admin passwords and SSIDs) so now I have a router that needs to be rebooted all the time and that won't save my settings when I do.\nMy theory is that it's a heat management issue, but I'm officially done fooling with the AC1200. I'm off to search for a replacement, wish me luck.\n** see also all the 1-star reviews on the other Amazon AC1200 listing"

     "comments": "Great specifications. Router runs fast and has decent WiFi coverage through the house. However, in my bedroom with strong signal it still disconnects and reconnects, and drops downloads and things. That's with 3-4 bars showing whenever I look (and the machine is stationary so I don't believe that ever changes). Also, the router tends to lock up after being up for a little bit, requiring a hard reboot at the machine to get it going again. I have checked repeatedly for new firmware to no avail.\nMy alarm system sends me notifications using the internet, so having the internet down during the day means my house is unprotected, as well as not being able to get to my data and access my software remotely.\nFor a brand new, and pretty expensive, router... I expect reliable connectivity. The TP-Link AC1200 is not providing it. It can have all the gigabit and USB ports in the world and the fastest AC WiFi available, and if it's not smooth and reliable, it does me no good."

Took 30 minutes phone call just to be transferred to somewhere else. Their main product registration page for warranty replacement has been down ever since I remember. No email or online chat for warranty replacement. You have to get past 30 minute long painful phone call experience and which I believe the customer reps are trained to not acknowledge a hardware defect.

I spent approximately 15 minutes from plugging it in to having it fully operational. Most of that time was spent reading the online guide, which was flawless. I highly recommend this to anyone. I receive the 5Mhz signal over 50 feet away with 4 walls to go through."

Basic install is simple and all went well until the last save and failed pops up..I've installed 2 routers the last one being a TP-link AC 750 which works fine.. My thought was to upgrade to this 1200 thinking I might get a more powerful signal and extended range.. I should have listened to the critics, they are right it doesn't work... I still want to up grade so which model in this price range works I just don't know............Amazon has at least renewed my faith in retailers, was very simple to return ................"

My old Cisco router was requiring a power cycle a couple times a week to wake up wireless, and we recently bought new property with a Mother in Law apartment to cover with wireless as well. This router was fast to configure, and covers our entire property in strong wireless signal, much better than the old Cisco N router did. Good price too."

     "comments": "Despite the many positive reviews, I found the signal quality to be severely lacking on this model. Given how poorly it was receiving all the local channels (every one of which is within 30 miles of my house), I took some notes and did comparisons with all three TVs in my house in different locations. I compared it to the Antennas Direct 50 Mile Range Clearstream Eclipse Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna, White/Black (ECL-A) (which I ordered shortly after due to the poor coverage) and, before that arrived, I also tested out a control in the form of a 6' piece of coaxial cable, plugged into nothing.The piece of coaxial cable, while picking up very few channels, did almost as well as the 1byone in almost all cases. The other antenna got nearly double the channels, in most cases, and the signal on all channels was improved. So, despite the popularity, you might want to do some more research and see if you can find actual reviews with testing and rankings of models, as the tastes of Amazon reviewers leaves a lot to be desired, especially in a suburban setting."

     "comments": "Initially I loved this antenna. It picked up 48 OTA channels, half of them Spanish or Asian language channels, but 48!!! I first placed it beside the TV with the stand that you can buy separately and nada! zero! zilch! Then I hung it in the window and things got much better. I'm in a first floor apartment and the window is set 6 feet back from the patio front and overhung by the second floor balcony. 48!! Reception was very clear. Every so often the signal would weaken causing 3 to 4 seconds of pixelation. I resolved that by plugging the USB powered amplifier into a power strip rather than the TV's USB. Maybe the TV doesn't supply enough continuous power to the USB ports? I don't know. Wasn't a big deal and I didn't pursue the issue.\nThen... it fell. About 3 feet and hit the sill. The antenna is made of very rigid plastic, not at all bendable. So when it fell a small piece of that plastic in the corner broke off. Mind you I had used the 3M adhesive included with the product. I thought that little piece wouldn't affect reception because it's housing and not the internal antenna. It worked, off and on, for the rest of the day but the next morning... dead. I rescanned for channels and nothing. I returned it and bought the\nWinegard FlatWave Amped 50 mile range antenna. The construction is a lot better. It picked up 12 less channels, all Spanish language, but I receive the 8 OTA channels I wanted without issue."

Played Far Cry 4 and Fallout 4. A few dropped signals with this and the Steam Link, but very few for the full length of both games. I'd say the Steam Link was a tad better holding the WiFi. However, this works with my old Logitech MX Air Mouse, and the Steam Link doesn't. Both worked with two different bluetooth keyboards and an XBox 360 controller. The Shield includes it's own game controller with just a couple different button locations from an Xbox 360 controller. It did get confused if my game crashed, and a restart got it going again.\nI used the Plex App on it, and a couple other Android apps from the Google Play store and they worked great. The Plex app on this is different than on the Roku. I personally prefer the Roku version as it seems to have more ways to list shows.\nI used it to stream some YouTube music videos and it worked well. However, for me it's about bringing my PC games into the living room, while leaving my PC at my desk."

It's simple enough for non-geeks to plug in and start streaming Netflix, Amazon, Google Play, etc. If that's all you need, though, you might consider saving some money and going with either a Roku or Fire TV, but I will say that I prefer the interface of the Shield TV to either of those options. However, if you're like me, and a big nerd about this stuff, then forget all the other options: the Shield TV is the king. I'll get into some reasons (as well as some frustrations), but there are so many that I'm sure I'll forget some.\n1. Ticks all the streaming boxes: Netflix, Amazon, Google, Hulu and everything else you can think of (except Apple, of course): Not only is it the only machine that can say that, but it does it right: 4K all around, and for Google, you get the entire Play Store ecosystem and an official (and slick) YouTube app. Most of these are also integrated to the point where you can do one search to expose content in several services (except Amazon Prime Video, that is still in its own silo).\n2. Home media integrations: As someone with a large collection of digital media, this was a big one for me. The Shield TV has so many options for playing local and network files ranging in simplicity from plugging in a USB drive to hosting a Plex Media Center and lots of in-between options. Personally, I am using it as a Plex Media Client with my server still hosted on my PC, but I also use Kodi and have my media library on my PC mapped as a network storage location on the Shield, which then allows for my library to be accessed from Kodi. As long as you can get to the media, you can play it on the Shield TV one way or another. You can also plug in a USB 3.0 drive and use it as adopted storage for your Shield TV, which I recommend if you are going to be installing apps and games much. All of these capabilities work as expected, but I did encounter some error messages along the way. However, after a few tries, everything turned out OK.\n3. Gaming: the gaming capabilities of the Shield TV are awesome, but confusing and sometimes unreliable. The simplest option is to install games from Google Play Games. Nvidia has even ported some PC games over to Android specifically for this purpose, but as long as the game works with a controller, you're pretty much good to go for Play Store games. Next, you have GeForce Now, which is like Netflix for games, and it rocks. The selection of games is a little small for now, but I found plenty that I liked. This is a great option for people without dedicated gaming rigs and even on my low-tier internet package, it was serviceable. Finally, there's Gamestream, which is my preferred way to play. In fact, I went and and bought a EVGA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti SC GAMING, 4GB GDDR5, DX12 OSD Support (PXOC) (04G-P4-6253-KR) just so I could do this. When it works, it's amazing, but so far I've found it only works on about half the games I want to play. For Example: Borderlands 2 is a \"go\", Mass Effect 3 is a \"no-go\".\n4. Hardware: Speaking of gaming, the included controller is amazing (comparable to the XBox 360 controller which is very familiar to me). The remote is pretty good but not quite perfect: they took away the headphone jack, which is too bad. The volume control is a neat idea, but not responsive or obvious enough for me. Also, I wish the thing just had a power button. The integration of the IR blaster is awesome though: I love being able to turn my TV on and off with the device and control the volume of my receiver from the same little remote. They also axed some of the storage options for the non-pro model. I really wish that they had put in an extra USB port or something, especially when you're basically forced into using one of them for adopted storage. I don't have anything in the second port now, but it stresses me out to think I can only plug one more thing in, whatever that eventually is. The hardware is amazing where it counts though: it's super fast and looks great.\n5. The Future! As fun and functional as the Shield TV is, there is the additional promise of the big update that incorporates Google Home functionality using the controller as the far-field microphone input. This, along with the Spot microphones which add additional interaction points to Google Home, will add a whole new dimension to the device. I can't wait for that!\nSome buggy stuff:\n1. The initial setup was harder than it should have been. There was a bug that prevented me from authenticating my Google account from my phone, as it tried to have me do. Then it failed to update after downloading the entire 1-gigabyte file, which it had to start over. Hopefully by the time you're reading this they've managed to iron out these details. Nothing kills your enthusiasm like running into bugs in the initial setup process.\n2. I purchased the Samsung 128GB BAR (PLASTIC) USB 3.0 Flash Drive (MUF-128BC/AM) to use as adopted storage specifically because it was one of the few that were recommended by Nvidia for this purpose. However, getting it to work was a pain. First appeared to freeze during the process of formatting the drive and then it wouldn't be found or the format would be incorrect, I had to restart several times. Then it reported that the drive might be slow, which doesn't make sense because it's USB 3.0 and specifically recommended as the one you're supposed to use!"

     "comments": "Not a good local media player. At all. The local library does not show you file names, just a random, large thumbnail; no text anywhere in the library. So let's say you have 5 files of that are of the same content, you have no idea what you're selecting if you can't read the file name!\nAlso, this player has very little customization. You can't change the background (rather ugly baked-in). You can't change how the local media app loads the files; it's just all giant thumbnails. A list view would be awesome.\nLastly, this is supposed to support USB 3.0. I used an Nvidia-recommneded flash drive (over 200mbps read) and it chokes trying to play back an MP4 encoded at 30mbps. Not good!\nI would not recommend this as a general media player."

     "comments": "I got the shield TV mostly to use for Amazon Prime Video, since my ATV 4th gen didn't have it.\nI think it's a great product, Nvidia GeForce streaming to my PC works great (over gigabit network), and the controller is very nice/sturdy and so is the remote. Overall very satisfied with this product!\nWhy 3 Stars: Well I use Comcast/Xfinity, and Comcast doesn't allow this device to be activated with HBO Go and Showtime Anytime, I know this is a Comcast related issue, but I wish Nvidia/Google would push Comcast to allow Android TV devices to be authenticated on their network. I understand I could instead use HBO Now or Showtime and directly subscribe to them, but that's at extra cost (lose cable discount) and I like the fact that I get those channels on my TV and shows recorded on Tivo as well. I have contacted both Nvidia and Comcast on their FB/Twitter feeds and there are a lot of people frustrated by Comcast's action."

     "comments": "I had the older version for a short time before returning it and I have had the newer one since its release. It is a great android TV device and has handled almost everything I throw at it flawlessly. Not only is it quick and powerful, but NVIDIA also performed whatever blood sacrifice is required to get Amazon to approve the Prime Instant Video app for the device. I've used it to stream games from my gaming PC and to stream content from a number of sources like Google, Hulu, Amazon, Netflix, HBO Go, and PBS. It can also stream from other devices just like a Chromecast. I have only one complaint though I have to emphasize that it is a rather consistent frustration. The remote sucks.\nI loved the first iteration of the remove in the original Shield TV. It was snappy and had a very convenient headphone jack that I would use when there was too much background noise or when I wanted to quietly watch something early in the morning. Sure, the rechargeable battery likely didn't last as long and after enough time would likely fail to even hold a charge. The new remote, however, did away with the headphone jack and is incredibly frustrating to use. Commands issued to the remote (with line of site to the device and only about 7-8 feet away) are often delayed, sometimes for several seconds making you question whether your action registered, and then all commands are suddenly released in a burst. To make things worse, I frequently end up pausing content when I just set the remote down somewhere. I don't know if the change in momentum is setting off the center button or if it is something else. The capacitive touch volume slider is also very awkward to use, which is only made more frustrating when combined with the delayed response to commands. This can then result in raising the volume way too high and blowing out my ears. All of this can make using the remote very annoying. While I love the size and feel of the remote, I often switch to using the awkward game controller to control the ShieldTV instead.\nI like the new controller, but it again uses the weird capacitive slider for volume and it also has some very sensitive pause, back, and home buttons in the bottom center of the controller. This often causes me to press them by accident when picking up the controller by the center.\nI would recommend the unit and I wish I was vindictive enough to rate it lower just to highlight the remote issues but, alas, I like the device far too much (despite the failings of its remote) to give it anything less than 4 stars."

     "comments": "I bought this to replace my Roku Ultra, so keep in mind that I'm looking at the Shield TV as an upgraded streaming box for my home theater, not a console for my gaming arsenal (although, I do happen to be a gamer). My main attraction to the Shield TV is that it's the only streaming box other than Roku Ultra that supports 4k HDR. The Shield TV turned out to be an upgrade in every aspect.\nAbout Controls:\nFirst of all, it works just fine with my Logitech Harmony Companion remote, which comes with a Harmony Hub. Older Harmony remotes may not work, or may have to use some kind of workaround, but the current generation Harmony remote works beautifully.\nThe controller is very very nice. Far beyond the quality I expected. My biggest nitpick is the omission of \"Start\" and \"Select\" buttons, which can be problematic when emulating Playstation games.\nThird Party bluetooth controllers seem right at home with the Shield TV. My 8Bitdo pad paired right up and works great. Any paired remote, gamepad, keyboard, or mouse will work for all menus, so you can use pretty much whatever you want, as long as it's bluetooth or USB, and Android compatible.\nBrowsing through menus, Netflix, etc. is very snappy and responsive, owing to the overkill processor this thing is packing. Android compatible game emulators such as EPSXE and Mupen64 run very well, although keep in mind that retro game emulation always has minor bugs that have nothing to do with how powerful your hardware is.\nNetflix runs exactly as well as it did on the Roku Ultra. I have installed a Cat6 port to avoid dealing with wifi, but before I got that done, everything worked as expected over wifi.\nYoutube actually works a bit better, as viewing different resolution videos on the Roku always threw my receiver for a loop for some reason. By best guess on this is that maybe the Shield TV upscales everything to the resolution you set, rather than letting youtube change the output size, forcing receivers to autodetect every time. Whatever the reason, my Youtube experience is much improved.\nThe thing I like most about this platform is the freedom. Android TV is basically just Android OS, so you can sideload a lot of useful apps and just use a mouse in lieu of touch input. In other words, it's an open platform, and you can do more or less whatever you want.\nIt's not perfect. There will be some issues and annoyances that will be dealbreakers for some people. It's not for everybody, but speaking as a home theater enthusiast who likes games, it's an absolute slam dunk for me.\nUnfortunately, since I'm running AMD graphics in my PC, I haven't been able to try streaming games from my PC, but I've had such a positive experience with the SHIELD TV so far, I'm more likely to buy an NVIDIA graphics card in the future to gain the option of PC gaming in the living room."

     "comments": "We bought the Nvidia Shield to replace a much beloved Amazon Fire TV. While we really liked the Fire TV (1st Gen) it seemed underpowered for the type of streaming that we were doing. While we had no interest in the gaming aspect of the Shield, and it was a good bit more expensive then a new Fire TV, it seemed like the most robust streaming device. My husband is a IT expert and puts a lot of research into these types of devices.\nWe had already owned the previously mentioned Fire TV, and have also owned a Fire TV Stick and three different Roku devices. As cord cutters for several years now this device is the heart of our AV system and needed to have the power to handle both live streaming as well as local media files. Kodi runs very well on it as do the other apps that we’ve installed.\nOur biggest complaint would have to be the remote. While it has a nice feel, and is very stylish, it is extremely touchy. Just shifting it around in your hand can cause you to close out of an app or jump out of a program. I much prefer the remote from the Amazon Fire TV over this one. Other than that, the Shield is the best streaming option that you can find."

This behavior is definitely not typical of an Android update for any box I've ever owned so it freaked me out immediately. A little fair warning if this happens to anyone else."

     "comments": "I would like to divide this review into 2 parts -\n1. Delivery\nAs many other customers must have earlier testified, Amazon always goes the extra mile in ensuring that their customers are happy. Something similar happened with me. I ordered this product from India and as this was my first international order from Amazon I was a bit concerned as to how and when it'll reach. I opted for the standard shipping model. However when I called to know if the product had been shipped, the customer care executive just put my product in the expedited shipping option, free of charge. THANK YOU AMAZON :)\n2. The Product\nI watched many review videos etc on YouTube and other online sources before going in for the Shield TV, and it's been nothing short of amazing. Agreed, if you're a hardcore gamer then you're probably better off with a Playstation or an X-Box. But if you're a casual gamer and streamer like the most of us, there is no better option out there.\nAlso, another hack is to buy the 16 GB version only. It's quite easy to attach an external storage device. In fact I had an older model of the Seagate external hard disk that works with an external electric adapter. I know it's a bit old but the plus point being, it's a mammoth 1.5 TB. So now I have practically unlimited storage space for gaming, streaming or what have you. THANKS NVIDIA FOR BRINGING THIS INTO THE MARKET :)"

     "comments": "My star rating has gone up and down like a roller coaster. As we tried to prefect the settings we indirectly killed our performance. We were seeing the 5.0 drop off all the time. If you google the scenario Asus AC88U dropping 5.0mhz you will find enough reading material to keep you up for days.\nAfter a month of rebooting it at least once a day we are now stable and bridged to another Asus RT-ACRH13 as a wired bridge.\nThe problems we observed are not unique to Asus. All the other manufacturers have similar issues reported. It is disturbing to buy a high end router and having to struggle configuring it....rolling back 1 version on the firmware...etc. Here are some of the changes we played with to finally become stable on 5.0. Internal transfers considering the distance are great. 500mb. It is the best we will be able to achieve wireless with all the walls using Auto channel selection, 20/40/80. Locking it in on 80 was causing drops.\nLocking it on 40 will not allow the 500+mb internal transfers to go so at that speed. We shut down Beamforming and MU-MIMO. Despite having an MU-MIMO device on the other end there was no performance increase and we were still dropping 5.0. Locking in a fixed channel we were also still dropping the 5.0 so we let it auto negotiate(even when we were set to 20/40/80). I believe adding the bridge router also an Asus creates a scenario for us that many will not experience over the airways with these transmitters being relatively close.\nI even went as far as to buy an LB1 little USB fan to place underneath the AC88U reading that heat build up may be causing the drops.\nIt made no difference. That said a cool router is a happier router so I am glad I bought it. So 5 stars now for the performance as we have it configured minus 1 star as it was a pain to get it working in our environment as we desired.\nIf my post here saves just 1 person from beating their head against the wall over their SSID falling off it will have been worth it."

     "comments": "Purchased this router last week through Amazon's warehouse open box deal to replace my ASUS AC68U. Setup process is similar to my old router. However after the setup, there is no 5G signal. I login to the router and found out 5G is actually broadcasting under 2.4G, see my first photo, control channel shows 153 for 2.4Ghz??? Under 5G setting, the channel shows 0, and no signal at all.\nReset the router few times, same issue. I also restore the firmware to different versions, same issue...Now the router doesn't have any signal at all. It shows 3 solid light plus one purple (not red) light. Reset button is not working anymore either.\nAlso the coating on top of the router is cracking and start to peeling off. It looks like I receive an unit that has all the issues ever mentioned under its review here."

They do not offer advanced replacement and I could not go weeks without a router so I purchased a new one intending to take the replacement to a condo to use. New one works fine but they returned the old one without fixing it saying it tested ok. Lets see, every 2.4 connection I make to it drops every few minutes. The new one. Connections up for two weeks now with no problem. Guess that is all that needs saying. This is not the first bad experience I have had with ASUS warranty being useless. Place I work banned IT from buying more ASUS equipment because we got same kind of treatment for laptops and desksides. Bottom line, if it works, a good router but do no expect them to honor the warranty without major headaches."

     "comments": "Edit: First of all I would like to change my review of this device because the issue I was having is not the fault of the router, rather its the fault of the Ethernet cable that was being used between the cable modem and the router and the stock Asus firmware which still will not work right with Comcast cable. I'm using the supplied cable to the second ISP as I run dual WAN so I used the old cable from the modem to the router WAN port. I narrowed down the possibilities to the modem or the cable and tried switching the Ethernet cable with a high quality high bandwidth shielded cat 6 cable. Since doing that I have not lost my IPv6 connection to the modem using Merlin's firmware and all clients on my network have been able to retain their wired and wireless IPv6 connections with absolutely no downtime. I am still running Merlin's firmware version 380.66 alpha 3 which is working great for me and incorporates some of Asus's 7378 improvements that have not yet been included in the official firmware for this unit. Asus should consider some prefix designation specific settings for their IPv6 menu that mimic those that Merlin has incorporated into his menu for customers using Comcast cable.\nThe radio is strong and covers my house with a strong 5ghz signal that no other router I've ever owned could do. In many places even the netgear r8000 I tried last year left dead zones that the RT-AC88U covers. The interface GUI is very intuitive and offers many settings and an ease of navigation that other routers don't offer. Although this model allows for two DNS server designations I would like to see 3 or more in the menu. I have used this unit in failover mode with Comcast as my primary provider and AT&T VDSL as the second ISP and after properly configuring the AT&T modem/router to DMZ the IP address to the router it works just fine. Currently I'm using load balancing with a ratio of 8:2 and my clients are able to access the network without any issues. I also like how the network map shows the clients and their connection method along with time connected and RX/TX speeds which is something that no other router I've owned has done.\nAsus you still need to revise your firmware and how it handles an IPv6 connection to Comcast cable so users can obtain an IPv6 address for their clients. I tried the stock 7266 firmware this morning and it will not obtain an IPv6 address from Comcast, however, just as soon as I reload any Merlin firmware version it will immediately obtain an IPv6 connection to Comcast using prefix designation.\nAgain I must apologize as it was my Ethernet cable that was the issue all along and not the router and I have adjusted my review to reflect that the error was on my end and not with this product. I have included a picture of Merlin's IPv6 menu so Asus can see what Comcast customers would like to see incorporated into the stock firmware."

     "comments": "This was my second ASUS Router, after the AC66U, which for the price and longevity was and still is a phenomenal router. I purchased the AC88U in hope it would increase our wifi signal throughout our apartment and provide faster device-device transfer speeds. The router performed amazingly well when it worked... We have Spectrum Ultimate 300Mbps Internet and on the 5GHz band we would pull 330-355Mbps download, but the 5GHz band dropped connection frequently and had terrible range. I sat 10 feet from router and had less than 70% signal on 5G and 85% signal on 2.4G. The 2.4G was stable and reliable but transfer speeds were expected, no more than 100Mbps. I reset the router 3 times in hopes of making the 5G network come back alive after it would go off. It worked for one week and again we would have same issue. I love ASUS routers and their user interface but this particular model is very buggy and runs extremely warm. I loved having the 8 Ethernet ports as well, but for now I'm going back to my reliable AC66U."

     "comments": "Hard to tell if the problem is the Pluggable USB Bluetooth adapter or Microsoft's Windows 10 Creator Update edition The product out of the box appears to work great with an old Logitech V470 BT 2.0 mouse The problem is that several times a day, BT connectivity just goes away. Turning BT off and on again does not restore it. Only a reboot does. Then again BT works great until the next connectivity loss The instructions that come with the device say it is just Plug N' Play with Windows 10. Only be sure to remove any previous BT software, of which I have none (in Device Manager only the Logitech mouse, the Pluggable device, Device Identification, and Microsoft Services show). The previous BT adapter and the Logitech mouse were both used as Plug N' Play devices with no management software or drivers others than those provided by Windows installed for either. But whatever the actually origin of the problem is, I fault Pluggable for leaving the user holding the bag. I've never had a Logitech BT device that tells me that I as a user must become a \"geek\" to use their device. The Logitech installations are very user-friendly and pretty much do all the work and thinking for the user. Pluggable should do the same.\nUpdate(4/9/17). Reinstalling the driver in Device Manager on my Win10 computer also fixes lost connectivity, at least temporarily. Find the Broadcomm BCM20702 Bluetooth 4.0 USB Device under Bluetooth. Mouse right click, Pick Update Driver, then Browse My Computer, then Let Me Pick From a List of Available Drivers, then Broadcomm BCM20702 Bluetooth 4.0 USB Device. It may take one or two minutes to reinstall the driver. After that I regained connectivity without having to reboot."

     "comments": "Redeemed an Acer R 13 (R7-371T) with weak built-in wifi that was getting in the way of my online work. After moving to a new apartment shared with roommates, my laptop became nearly useless since it couldn't sustain a wifi connection unless I was within 10 feet of the router. Was about to give up and sell it off for a different model but decided to try this first. Setup was easy and immediately I had a strong signal from everywhere in the apartment, even through several walls to my room, and a good distance outside as well. Signal strength is still very good if I remove the antenna, but knowing me I'd probably misplace it if I didn't keep it on there and I don't mind it sticking out anyway. Bonus: this adapter also works great with macOS Sierra on a hackintosh setup I have running on an old PC desktop. I'll probably pick up another of these so that I can have both the laptop and desktop online at the same time and sync files more easily between them."

Not to mention that it is 2017 and one should not have to manually compile anything (or ever run a script to compile) for Linux anymore.\nI gave this 2 stars because in Windows, it works quite well. However, packaging clearly states this is Linux compatible, when it definitely is not. -1 star for not supporting Linux int his day and age and -2 stars for false advertising. Install is quite easy in Windows and speeds are as expected.\nOverall, this is good for Windows users, but if you are trying to use this in Linux (any distro), then look elsewhere. Seller even states in a Q&A that this is not supported in Linux."

The only problem I had was that after getting these set up, they auto-updated the software and the app got frozen -- although the eeros themselves were working. I finally deleted the app and reinstalled it and everything has been good since then. I am surprised that I do get an occasional message when trying to use my iPad and my Apple TV, both in the same room as an eero, telling me that the signal is too weak. There is a clear line of sight between all three devices and the Apple TV is close to the eero but a bit lower. I'll experiment a bit with placement and assume this will be resolved. Regardless, I would recommend these because of the design, ease of set up and blanket coverage elsewhere in my house."

     "comments": "This is the most amazing wifi product that I have ever owned. I have been dealing with dead spots in my home for what seems to be decades and family members that bugged me to figure out how to fix the dead spot problems. In December of '16 I purchased a luma system and spent hours on the phone with their tech support trying to get the system to work i finally gave up returning the luma system and buying the Eero system.\nTo my amazement I installed it in minutes and it has been working flawlessly for many months now. I no longer have any dead spots in my home or even around my home. I plan on adding 2 more nodes in the future, one for my garage and possibly another at the pool.\nThe system is expensive but i have found that it is worth every penny i paid for it. No more wifi complaints!!!!!"

     "comments": "I've had this for about 6 months now. Works great. Great coverage across my house and yard, and stable as a rock.\nI had a problem early on where some devices would just momentarily disconnect from the wifi and then reconnect (and page loads and stuff would time-out in between). It was annoying, and started getting more frequent. I contacted support, and they were very responsive. They reported back that one of the units was reporting that it was overheating indicating that it might be defective, so they sent me a replacement unit for it. That resolved my problem.\nIts a good product and service has been good, and overall I am satisfied with it, but its still pretty dang expensive for what it is (hence the 4 stars)."

Going from the main eero downstairs to the others upstairs rendered a weak signal, but hard wiring it was worth it. I'm getting over 200mb in my past deads spots, such as the master bed room and deck, which makes this purchase worth the money as it works and communicates with itself to keep working and it did not interfere with my TV downstairs I have hard wired to the xfinity modem.

     "comments": "I bought these to replace a couple of Ethernet connected Apple AirPorts which have been getting progressively worse in terms of throughput and stability. They're 3+ years old, which is far beyond the lifespan of most WiFi routers that I've had in the past.\nI have a decent sized home, so I knew that a normal WiFi router wasn't going to fit the bill. I narrowed the choices down to the eero, Google WiFi, and the Netgear Orbi. I've been watching the eero's for well over a year now, and based on other stellar reviews, I decided to take the leap and buy them.\nThe eero \"kit\" comes with three units that are fairly small--about 4 inches square and an inch high. They come in a handsome box and are packaged much like your typical Apple device. Very easy to open and very little instructions are provided (or needed). Simply unbox them, install the smartphone app (iOS and Android supported), and plug the first one (marked 'Start Here') to your internet modem and power. Then fire up the smart phone app, which leads you through the process of naming and configuring the eero. Took literally about 3 minutes.\nAfter the first eero is up and running, you repeat the process for the other two, sans the connect-to-Internet-modem part. They recommend the second unit is placed somewhere around the middle of the house, and the third unit at the far end of the house. The two \"satellite\" units do not require any connectivity other than power. Setup was even easier with the app--literally 60 seconds or so.\nAnd since I kept the same network name (SSID) and WPA2 password that I used with my old AirPorts, all of my wireless devices magically connected to the eeros with no reconfiguration required. The eero app allows you to quickly see which devices are connected, which eero they're connected to, and their signal strength.\nNow for the cool part. WiFi throughput is unbelievable. On newer devices that support 802.11a, I'm routinely getting 100 mbps throughput. Older devices are also pretty darn fast, in the 40-50 mbps range. Another great feature of the eero is that the three units all work together as a single unit, so you can roam around the house and can be pretty much guaranteed \"5 bar\" signal strength everywhere, with no drop outs. Fantastic!\nI did wind up connecting my furthest eero to an Ethernet \"hard line\" as I already had a line down there, and I get slightly better throughput that way. That said, if I didn't have the line already down there, I would have been perfectly happy running both satellites in wireless mode. The throughput of the units continues to impress me, especially with the entire household on them--18 devices on average. I have noticed an appreciable increase in the performance of streaming apps and devices like NetFlix, Plex, Roku and Chromecasts.\nAnother great feature is the ability to assign WiFi devices to profiles, which can then be assigned to a schedule. This is great for kids, as it's possible to automatically (or manually) \"pause\" their Internet access, such as during dinner time or at night. And the smartphone app makes it really easy to manually pause access. It takes literally 15 seconds to pause/unpause internet access.\nIn summary, I'm happy as a clam with my eeros. Although they required a significant investment, I couldn't be happier with the ease of setup and performance delivered. If you've got the money and your WiFi coverage is driving you nuts, don't hesitate to run out and get a set of these gems. You'll be glad you did!"

     "comments": "I very rarely leave reviews but felt compelled to leave a review for Eero. I never thought it would be possible to fall in love with wireless networking again.\nI live in a 2 story, 1700 townhouse that has the router/modem located in my 2nd floor office. The signal strength was strong upstairs and fairly decent downstairs. The problem I was having was keeping all my devices downstairs (TV, Apple TV, Fire Stick, Amazon Echo, Smart Plugs) connected all the time.\nI took the plunge and boy have I never regretted it since. Setup was dead simple. Due to the fact I had an Arris router/modem combo for Xfinity I had to switch the router to Bridge modem to account for the new Eero introduced to the network. Setup was simple. Even better, if you name the Eero wireless network the same as your previous network, with the same password, all your devices automatically connect without the need to re-login.\nEven more impressive is the customer service. I wanted to make sure my setup was ideal. I figured if I were going to invest in this type of system, I want it done perfectly. I decided to create a layout of my home with Visio to send to the Eero team. They assured me after reviewing my layout that my setup was perfect. I asked if another Eero would have been necessary and they suggested my setup was perfect. No oversell. Just quality customer service and timely feedback.\nI have not experienced one hiccup since using Eero. Access points are always up and my speeds are always optimal. I have Xfinity with 50MB down and 12MB up. I consistently hold speeds around 88 down and 12 up in every last square inch of my house, including bathrooms with doors closed.\nOne last thing. Eero has improved the range so well on my Wifi that my Arlo cameras hold full signal outside of the house. I also have an AT&T Microcell to boost my signal. I can now hookup to the Microcell as I pull into the driveway.\nI’d like to add one more Eero to my master bedroom to create even better handoff from Office -> Room -> Downstairs but not ready to invest yet.\nI love this product. You will not be disappointed."

     "comments": "I bought this to replace my old Ubee wifi router/modem that I was leasing through TWC (now Spectrum). Installation was easy, directions are straight forward, and I was up and running after a few minutes and calling the cable company. Immediately I noticed better performance (in terms of speed) than with the old router/modem.\nThe problem lies in the overall range of the router/modem (talking about the 6700, specifically). I live in a 1500 sq ft ranch with the modem setup in the living room. Even at the other end of the house, where our bedroom is (again, it's only a ranch, so it's not that long), the signal was starting to weaken. My laptop also shows 4 out of 5 bars of signal strength sitting on the couch 10 feet away. Also, the signal has trouble reaching my PS4 in the room directly below where the router/modem is. I also have to regularly reset the router/modem to connect to my PS4 because it won't pick up the signal. I'm not sure if this is due to a weak signal strength or an issue with the PS4; however, I will say, with the Ubee model from TWC (which I consider to be inferior) I never once had a problem picking up the signal in other rooms of the house.\nFinal thoughts: good performance and speeds; not so good on the signal strength."

     "comments": "We replaced our modem Nov 2, 2016. On April 6, 2017 I called Comcast with steaming issues. My internet speed test was about half of what it should be. The Comcast rep told me my modem was at \"end of life\" status and wasn't supported any longer and suggested we replace it (with theirs, of course, at $9/month or so). They sent a signal and it still didn't fix it so I scheduled a service call. I then called Arris (and got right through to a PERSON, unlike Comcast) who informed me that my modem was NOT end of life, that this was the correct model number and that it is listed on Comcast's site as a recommended modem for people wanting to purchase their own. They call it end of life, because they don't lease out this model number any longer. He walked me through a few screens and all of a sudden my speed was faster than what ours is supposed to be at. The Arris rep thinks that their was noise on our line and it cleared after they resent the signal. He told me to keep retesting for speed and if it went back down to keep the Comcast appointment, otherwise I could probably cancel it. He was very helpful and polite. I could HEAR him clearly, unlike the Comcast rep, whom was using a headset that sounded like he was not talking into, even though I told him several times I couldn't hear him. I feel really good about Arris as a company and I would definitely recommend the company, along with this modem."

     "comments": "So I have been using the original Amazon Fire TV Sticks (2 of them) since they came out. I have 2 main uses for any such streaming device. I have a dedicated Plex server (i5-4430, 8GB RAM, 120GB SSD for OS, 16TB HDD 4x4TB, Windows Server 2012 r2 Essentials) so I need endpoints to play from and for streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Youtube, etc.\nFor a while the FTV sticks met my needs but over time I started noticing they got slower and slower...and they were not fast to begin with. It got to the point that the interface was slow to respond, I had constant issues with the Plex app crashing or saying my server was too slow to stream a given video, etc. Then I started to get choppy playback in streaming services like Amazon Prime and Netflix.\nIve got a great router (ASUS RT-AC88U) and internet (200mbps) and no other device on my network had these issues, Android phones, tablets, laptops, desktops. Also both fire sticks had the same problems escalating at the same time in the same way.\nI considered getting a Fire TV (non stick) but was concerned I may be in for more of the same. Also I found the interface to be a bit less than ideal. Not that I can blame them, but the interface centers around Amazon content, not apps, and you have basically no control over the order of things in the interface.\nI started to consider other options. The major, obvious competitor being Roku. I had heard good things and read up on it. They had all the apps I used including Amazon Prime, Plex, Netflix, and many others.\nIt then came to deciding which to get as they had refreshed the lineup and had many options. While I dont currently have a 4k TV I will likely upgrade in the near future and wanted something that could handle 4k, so that eliminated the Roku sticks. I also do not have the necessity to take the Roku on the go as I can hook up my phone or laptop for playback on the go. I wanted ethernet just in case so that left me between the premiere+ and the ultra.\nThe main reasons I chose the ultra over the premiere+ was the optical audio out, usb port, and voice search on the remote. I did however get a premiere+ to replace the second FTV stick in my bedroom about a week after using this. I intend to write a review on it, but if you do not need the 3 features I mentioned then the premiere+ will save you some money (I got it on sale here for $79).\nThe roku interface is simple, intuitive, and mostly uncluttered. Setup was a breeze. I was able to immediately find my way around and understand the settings and how to use it and so could my wife. Its app-centric and you have control over what order the apps are shown in. I was also impressed with the ability to remove some categories on the left like the \"store\" for movies and TV shows and news, further simplifying the interface.\nApps open almost instantly and I have yet to have an app crash. The settings are easy to work with. I added a 32GB Samsung Evo micro SD card to it and honestly I cant say if it improves much or not. Its likely overkill in terms of size (if not overall) but at $11 extra I figured might as well. I think the Roku just uses it as some sort of App cache, not storage in the traditional sense.\nThe voice search is ok but seems to lean more towards the major streaming services and pay to watch stuff. It may help for finding stuff in Netflix/Amazon Prime, but it doesn't work at all with Plex. Not a huge deal as I had pretty low expectations that it might.\nThe remote control built in audio jack for headphones is perfect. Volume is easily loud enough and audio quality is decent. The Android remote control app is very good and also offers the ability to do private listening. My only issue is that after about 10 mins the audio cuts out. I have a Pixel XL. I am not sure if its the app or the phone going into some sort of deep sleep or something but it renders the app useless for private listening, which is ashame because as nice as it works on the remote I am sure it will render the battery life on the remote pretty short.\nI also finally convinced my wife to cut the cord and ditch cable TV. I havent watched live TV for years and between Plex, streaming, and cord cutting subscription services it didnt make sense to pay for cable any more. We were able to cut our bill down from $170/mo for internet (150mbps) and TV to ~$70/mo for 200mbps internet. We then subscribed to Sling TV's $40/mo top package which satisfied my wifes desire for some live TV content. Saves us a nice bit of money every month, its more flexible (watch on the go, watch when we want, etc) and other than maybe the internet charge dont have to worry about the cable company hiking prices.\nAll in all I am very impressed with the Roku's top offering. Now I know someone will inevitably point out I have compared a $40 device against a device that costs nearly 3x as much and your right, because thats what I have to base my observations on. However, if I had the chance to sit down with both and compare them side by side before purchasing either, I would gladly pay the 3x as much for the much better experience. I have no doubt that comparing the Roku premiere+ or ultra to the Fire TV non-stick id make the same assertion.\nIf you want to cut the cord, have a plex server, or even just heavily watch a select few streaming services heavily and your current device/smart TV doesnt handle them well then I highly recommend the Roku."

     "comments": "I went through FOUR Amazon Fire TV boxes, 2 refurbished and 2 new, only one of them lasting nearly a month, the other three failing after no more than 2-3 days, and could not get an Amazon Fire TV Stick to last more than a month. This may have been due to some unknown incompatibility issues with my Samsung UN55KU6300 55-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV (2016 Model) but whatever it was it was extremely frustrating and a waste of my time and money.\nSo far the Roku Ultra is working solidly. I like the interface and what's available although I do miss the Kodi add-on that the Fire TVs could load. The Roku is faster than the Fire TV devices and although it's hard to tell, the picture quality appears to be a bit better too."

     "comments": "My history is that I have been a DIE HARD WD TV Live Plus user for many years and delayed switched to Roku for the longest time because of its lack of ability to play back all file types, specifically .mkv files, but with the release of the Roku 4 and the addition of a Plex media server to my life, I will never look back! I LOVE my Roku 4, but we just moved into a new house that has a dedicated theater room and needed a second Roku to stream content to that room in addition to the TV we have on another floor, so I bought the Roku Ultra so I could compare the two. Since we spent a lot of good money on a new Epson Home Cinema projector and Yamaha receiver, I wanted to be getting the most out of my streaming device.\nSo far the Roku Ultra has been great, though I wouldn't say it's been any better than our 4 has been. We use it primarily to stream content stored on a dedicated media server that I built out of an old computer. Basically I installed a 4TB WD blue hard drive to hold all my media in addition to the 1TB drive that runs the operating system and software. I connected it to my network and have it running all the time. It has no monitor or keyboard because I use Google remote desktop to run updates, make changes and add content when I need to. Anyway, that's another story. Between Plex, Amazon Prime, YouTube and Netflix, that's basically our Roku use in a nutshell, but we stream to multiple devices at a time in 1080p. We had trouble with glitchy streaming when we first bought our Roku 4 but I soon discovered it was because we needed a newer, better router, not because of any problem with the Roku. I upgraded to an awesome dual channel Asus router and use the 5Ghz channel exclusively for media streaming. Ever since then we have been GOLDEN!\nAs for the differences between the 4 and the Ultra, here's what I can tell you. The Ultra is significantly smaller which is great for those with very limited real estate on their entertainment centers but this wasn't an issue for me so the new smaller size really makes no difference. It's exactly the same in its thickness. See my pictures for side by side comparisons of the unit and remote of the 4 and the Ultra. The Ultra does seem to run a little cooler than the 4 but again, I never had problems with over heating with my 4. I have not noticed any difference in noise level between the two at all. The remote is a little different in a way that takes some getting used to if you've been using a 4. The main \"OK\" button on the Ultra is in the center of the arrows whereas on the 4 is was right underneath the arrows. If you're used to using a 4 remote, you'll end up hitting the search button a hundred times on the Ultra remote until you get used to the new layout. That's not a big issue but is a little annoying to me because we still use our 4, so we have to switch back and forth in our brains. Also, the Roku Ultra takes a completely different kind of power cable than the 4 does. The only reason I noticed this is because when the Ultra arrived, I went to swap it out with the 4 and thought I'd use the 4's power cable for the Ultra because I had already painstaking threaded it down through the holes and plugged it into the power source in our home theater stack. Alas, it does not fit in the Ultra's hole. Again, this isn't a problem since it comes with the right power cord for it's needs, but if continuity is your thing, be aware of these changes. Otherwise, the Ultra behaves in every way like the 4 does, which honestly I'm very happy about because I love my 4! If I had to buy again, I'd probably just buy a second 4 instead of the Ultra because for the price, it really does pretty much the same job.\nMy biggest complaint isn't about the Ultra itself but about all Roku devices that I keep hoping they will change with every new release, and that is parental controls. Roku absolutely, positively SUCKS at parental controls! GET WITH THE PROGRAM ROKU!!!\nThat being said, I'm definitely happy with the Ultra so far and can highly recommend it if you want your streaming device to be as small and as cool as possible. I bought this unit refurbished to save $20-30 and I'm glad I did. It came looking and working like new! For the record, I did not receive this for free or at a discount. Hope this helps!"

     "comments": "I would start by going to Roku's forum and read some threads there. You will see there are lots of people have the same issues I described below. Stay away from Roku. Very poor customer service, no audio, loud popping chirping, HDCP 2.2 errors, and no communication on a fix. In the forum there are threads of the problems described below going back to January 2017, 4 months and no update or communication of an update. My experience is below.\nI have/had a Roku 4 that displayed 4k content and had no issues with the sound, it worked great. Then I got an email promotion to get the Ultra at a discount because I already had a Roku 4. Great, I will move the 4 to the bedroom and put the ultra in the living room. But when I go to watch any movie on Vudu with the Ultra that is DD+ 7.1 I have no sound. The latest example would be Star Wars Rouge One, no sound when playing HDX DD+ 7.1. If I switch it to SD, which is DD+ 5.1 it works fine. On top of having no sound for some movies, I am also getting a loud chirping/popping every 10-15 minutes or so on all content. I am also getting HDCP 2.2 error sometimes when watching 4k movies. Again, the Roku 4 never had any of these issues with the same exact setup. I know what you are thinking, just move the Roku Ultra to the bedroom and the Roku 4 to the living room. Well the Roku 4 will no longer turn on and when I called about it I was told it was 2 weeks out of warranty, too bad, buy a new one. Very poor customer service and not very happy about that either but that is an entirely different issue. I was on the phone for 50 minutes last night with tech support and they gave me a case number (that I forgot at home so I don’t have it) and was told somebody else would call me back to help. Well no phone call. They had me unplug and plug in the Roku Ultra and the TV, didn’t work. Go through the settings on the Roku Ultra, didn’t work. Remove the Vudu channel and add it, didn’t work. Switch HDMI cables and HDMI ports on the TV, didn’t work. I went as far as to hook up the Roku Ultra directly to the receiver with an optical cable on the second optical input so it wouldn’t go through the TV, didn’t work. All the HDMI cables I have are rated for high speed 4k content. I have the Roku Ultra wired directly to my modem and is a 60 Mbps I am at the point now where I wish I never bought the Roku Ultra and I wish my Roku 4 still turned on. I am very, very disappointed in Roku and I don’t think I would recommend any Roku products to anybody."

This is a Roku support forum where MANY customers have expressed issues with Roku Ultra audio experiencing digital chirping, popping or clicking. I have reached out to Roku several times with VERY poor support. Every time I call, the agent goes through the regular support steps and are never aware of the issue. It's not until I get the manager on the phone and have them look at the forum, that they understand what I'm calling about.\nThe audio issue happens with all the channels I use at a frequency of every 10-15 minutes and as little as 2 minutes in between.\nMy device is up-to-date. I'm not using an audio-video receiver. The Roku Ultra is plugged directly into the VIZIO Model #E50u-D2 Display via HDMI and the Display is plugged directly into the Vizio Model #SB4551-D5 Sound Bar via HDMI-ARC.\nI've tried all the trouble shooting there is. Reset to factory default. Delete and reinstall the channel. Check internet speed (I have the Roku hard wired and get around 260Mbps down/up). Make sure night audio mode isn't on. Try different audio out types (auto, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, DTS). Switching to a different HDMI input on the display. Using a different HDMI cable. Chromecast works without issue. Apple TV works without issue. ROKU HAS ISSUES!\nI've asked Roku to do a recall or voluntary return and they don't care. I wish I had never purchased the Roku and I would NEVER recommend a friend get one. Get an Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV or some other device, NOT A ROKU!"

     "comments": "UPDATE 4/4/2017:\nAfter a lot of research, I found out that the Angry Birds Game license with ROKU has expired and this game is only found on the original Roku 2XS models now. After further research, I found that I can add a vanity code and PURCHASE Angry Birds Rio and Angry Birds Seasons for $4.99 each. Which I did today. However, these 2 Angry Birds games I purchased (like others I have bought) only show up on my ROKU 2 XS's and not on my Roku Premier + or my Roku Ultra. Very frustrating because the past games I have purchased for my Roku 2XS's all show up on the new Roku Models, but not the Angry Birds Rio or Angry Birds Seasons. **knocking off another star!**\n-----\nI own 4 Roku 2XS (since 2013) and they've worked great up until Dec. 2016, when now watching a video via Amazon Prime or Youtube or SlingTV, they all now RE-BOOT within 60 minutes when they never had a problem prior to Dec 2016. No fix for this strange problem and it coincidentally seems maybe Roku is forcing us to buy the NEWER models? Regardless, I plunged in and bought 2 replacements for 2 of my Roku 2 XS's.\nOne the Roku Premier+ and the other a Roku Ultra via Amazon. Both work great (so far) while watching movies for over 60 minutes, but my only BIG GRIPE is they have taken away the basic ANGRY BIRDS GAME (offered free with the ROKU 2XS) It is not offered free or for purchase at all on the newer ROKU Models! Sure they have the other games we've purchased with the Roku 2XS's now brought over to my new ROKU models as well as some other games for free and for purchase, but my problem is the NEW ROKU MODELS are missing the ANGRY BIRDS GAME. It is just not there for us now. The NEW ROKU models are very capable of handling the basic Angry Birds Game. So why isn't it offered?\nMy one 13 yr old twin son has Autism. HE LOVES this game! He plays it alone, and the best part is that he PLAYS WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS with this awesome game. I've messaged ROKU via Facebook how this very simple fun family game should be brought back to the NEWER ROKU Models. If the old Roku 2XS's can handle the Angry Birds game, certainly the new Roku Models can.\nI can't post my petition link on this issue here with my Amazon review, but maybe others out there can contact ROKU about bringing the Angry Birds Game back to the new ROKU models via email, twitter, or FB on this issue that would be great!\nIf Roku brings back this FUN FAMILY GAME (even if I have to purchase it) , I will raise my rating stars to 5."

Now I very well could have had a bad unit and a replacement maybe would have worked as advertised. However, during the troubleshooting process I came across the new Nvidia Shield TV and wow, I was missing out big time. I returned the Roku Ultra. It just seems like there are still bugs that need to be worked out with the device and how it plays very high quality content. Still love Roku as a service but they need better quality control."

Same movies through Samsung 4K Bluray (8500) may play just HDX.\nRoku streams through a Yamaha receiver. Roku needs to be rebooted (power off 10 secs then on) more often than I like (after freezing or a \"lack of bandwidth\" error . . . 50 MPS bandwidth connection) but I would buy it again.\nUniversal all in one remote produces multiple clicks on Roku if button push is even a little too long. Frustrating. I use the cell app remote rather than the Roku remote. Works great and always with me."

     "comments": "Before investing in a 4K TV, I decided to upgrade my streaming player for my 55-inch, 1080p set, so I took a chance on the Ultra. Several weeks of joy so far. Nice ride.\nVisual/audio quality greatly surpass the streaming apps in my several-year-old smart TV and my TiVo Roamio player (which I had already thought were good)). Netflix looks subjectively like Blu-ray and the optical audio (I'm using for an older AVR receiver) delivers superb 5.1 support.\nThis is my second Roku so I basically knew what to expect for set-up, including: make sure your network components are spec'd well for streaming and that your ISP delivers clean, steady data. (Avoid \"garbage in, garbage out.\") Here, I've got clean local network components and a 40 Mbps stream from ISP which are working pretty flawlessly.\nI've been luckier than some buyers who report big problems. I wonder how much impact the local home network has on overall performance for some dissatisfied buyers. (Don't get angry with me for asking; I certainly had a steep learning curve with my original Roku and remember having to upgrade my modem, router, ethernet cables, tweak my DNS providers, and even switch from one ISP to another, before I got my best results with my first Roku in 2009. Everyone's experience can differ but remember, it's a network appliance, and performance relies on such dependencies.)\nThere's a wide variety of Roku channels - some are great, some are schlock, others require a cable TV subscription (which I lack). It's fun to check for new ones but mostly this \"cord-cutter\" is watching Netflix, Amazon, YouTube (plus whatever my TV antenna brings in). This provides more content than I can keep up with, actually.\nFrustrated I couldn't teach Ultra commands to a universal remote (forum users complain of this: commands come out as double clicking when taught to some remotes). Then I found the inexpensive Harmony 650 has a profile for Ultra, which solved that. Also frustrated with periodic loud audio pops (again, forum users complain). Roku needs to post firmware fixes soon if they want enthusiastic mass buy-in.\nYour mileage may vary, but I'm having a great time so far with this gorgeous player and hope you do, too."

I've been tinkering with electronic devices for over 40 years and rarely has any device ever installed and set up as easily on the first attempt as this roku device. The video and audio is crisp and clear, no pixelation, stutter, or audio problems. I highly recommend this unit (I currently have sling tv with att internet through my av receiver/7.1 surround)."

     "comments": "I was given this much needed router as a gift and have no complaints so far. Set up was easy, I did have a slight problem due to not paying attention. Total installation time was about 20 minutes to set up to run successfully. Even though my old Linksys router could support up to 300mps, the speed wasn’t being realized. The speed of the internet increased considerably, but not like I want. However, I can’t attribute all this to the router, but also to my internet service provider. My download speed increased to 91.08mps, but the upload speed was only 23-74mps.\nI have a fire stick attached to a television in a room located at the other end of the house and there was slight improvement with streaming movies which is what I’m really concerned about. Watching movies is more enjoyable without a lot of buffering issues.\nThe dual band processing works very well because I primarily use a tablet whereas my son primarily uses the Xbox. My son said he hasn’t seen much improvement while gaming. Since I’m using an old Samsung Tab, the 2.4ghz signal is being utilized, which I didn’t have a problem with since my old internet connectivity was relatively stable.\nThis wireless router comes packaged with a CAT5 data cable, power adapter and instruction booklet."

     "comments": "I have had this router for about two weeks now and it is working great! Everything from the packaging to the glossy black finish gives it a slick look. The four antennas are a little oddly placed where it looks kind of strange but functionally they do the job. It has dual band 2.4G and 5G that provide super fast internet. I didn't realize how slow my single band router was until I plugged this one in. Set up was a breeze. Its pretty straight forward, I was set up in like 5-10 minutes after taking it out the box. The setup wizard walks you through everything. If you want to make further changes the web interface is simple and easy to navigate. I The stand is pretty solid but with the placement of the antennas the way it is standing in the pictures here is pretty much the only way it can be placed. Other than that everything has been great. I have not had any problem with all my devices connected to it. I have many laptops and smart home devices I use regularly and don't notice any drops or interruption of services. The range more than enough for my small home."

They found there is a issue at higher number of connections with current firmware. They did kindly offer to replace the router and I will be using it in WISP mode. I look forward to Hootoo updating their firmware in future, so if you have a small home network (<8-10 devices) you should be fine, any more I'd wait until that is ready.\n============================\nPrice was right, but performance was lacking. When it worked, it was nice - great speed etc., but it dropped connections way too often on all bands. Some devices would also show as connected with no internet connection while others were connected. I had about 10-15 devices connected so your mileage may vary. Returned with no issues."

And very good signal with 6 antennas. My house is narrow but long, I have to put two routers at two ends since there is no good location in the center. But ASUS AC3200has such strong signal with 45° position toward the other side from my office! Save one router for me.😃😃😃"

The old router doesn't have any external antennas and was only wireless G and signal was better than this new one, this one has 4 external antennas 2 for 2.4g and 2 for 5g and the signal strength is weaker than the old one, go figure. The only benefit I get from this is the AC wifi and the 5g parts which my smart TV uses, but hey for the price this will work I'll just have to keep the old router up for the extra signal distance.\nOn a side note as other reviewers have stated the gateway IP isn't what they have in the documentation, well kinda sorta. If you connect to the router with the net disconnected the 10.10.10.252 will work but as soon as you connect it to the net it changed to 192.168.1.252, kinda strange but I'm not a IT guy by any stretch of the imagination."

Restarting my network would restore normal speed.

Every attempt to login with that address caused the guts in my Netgear cable modem/router to ask for Netgear Genie credentials. Using http://dlinkrouter.local./ had google sending me to a website with an emulator of the login screen. After mucho scratching and digging, I found that this router identifies itself as 192.168.100.1 Once I stumbled on that, everything went smoothly and it's a strong and powerful router. I know there are lot of reviews and questions, and I may have the only 859 that has this boogled-up address scheme, but if you get nowhere with 0.1, try 100.1\nAnd, of course, everything in system that was not DHCP had to have the ip addresses changed to reflect the 100 instead of 0.

     "comments": "This is my first AC Router having come from an ASUS N300 Router. I am using this as a simple Access Point (disabled DHCP, manual set LAN address). The interface is rather simple for ease. I prefer the ASUS style interface, but the DLink interface will do for most users. The highlight is the powerful WiFi on both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. My devices are much faster and have better range than before. Where I was previously getting 5Mbps before, I can now get 65 Mbps from the same distance. My tablets are totally usable in the farthest room. The styling is unobtrusive, but the unit does lack the USB port found on competing devices. USB would have been nice to have, but I did not need it. I got this on an Amazon lightning sale and figured that my old router needed an upgrade after 2 years. There is not much posted as to the integrated cpu in this product. After some searching, I found the following specs: Qualcomm Atheros QCA9563 (750 MHz) single core, 128 MB RAM, 3x3 MIMO. I also appreciate that it has Gigabit LAN. All of my previous routers had the 4 port fast ethernet (100Mbps) switch because they were cheaper. All I needed was an inexpensive (less than $100) wifi router that could outperform my old one."

     "comments": "This is a very good modem - very fast, well built and thought out. It is a later rev to the Arris version and this motorola has a power switch. I feel the case is better ventilated as well. I have cox communications and I am on their premier plan at 300/30. I regularly see 350 / 50 with this modem! HUGE step up from my old 4x4 surfboard which could barely squeak out 130ish down.\nNow for the single issue I have had. I also posted this on the egg for others to find:\nI have had the modem about 2 months maybe. In the last few weeks I started to see random lost connections. Movies / games or whatever would suddenly drop and I would see on my router that internet connection was lost. Modem still had all lights on and all looked OK but clearly was not.\nSo with that, I started to troubleshoot. From experience, I always look at the cheap wall wart power supplies all manufacturers seem to supply with their products (manufacturers, I would seriously pay extra if you advertised a top notch supply with your products!). Glad I started here first - upon testing without load, the 12V supply was only putting out 9V. Under load it would dip under 9V into the 8.5 range. In short, the PSU is done. Since finding this, I hooked the modem to a lab grade linear in my office and all seems stable, I am not seeing any drop off as of yet so the drop out does not appear to be the modem itself - the dirt cheap power supply seems to be the cause. So, I have ordered in a replacement power supply from a very reputable company named MeanWell. They make about the best affordable smps supplies around. The model I put on order in case anyone else has this issue is GST25A12-P1J. This is a 2A rated 12V supply and should plug directly into the modem without modification as the modem appears to have a 2.1mm x 5.5 barrel connector input. The modem states on the label it requires a 12v 1a supply. I prefer headroom on any power supply so the 2A version was a perfect option.\nI also had to buy a much larger version for my linksys wrt1900ac router as its power supply flat out failed (it happens with cheap switching supplies). Most will discard a device when it stops working - always check the power supply as the fix may only cost less than $20! To note, the one used on my linksys router was a GST60A12-P1J which is a 5A rated 12V supply.\nHope this helps some of you! If I can update this review later with a more long term test, I will do so."

     "comments": "I've had this for about a month now. I came close to returning it for another modem. The reason is that I'm not getting a consistent speed along with the advertised speed I purchased from my ISP, that is Comcast.\nI have blast internet, 150mbps, and in the beginning I was amazed I was getting more than what I was getting, around 200+Mbps... This was also at around 2am in the morning. I wake up and tested it again in the afternoon, it was a paltry 8-15mbps with a higher upload of around 11mbps.\nLike every regular individual who has dealt with different ISP, I rebooted the modem and the wifi and waited. So after it was done it was surprisingly fast again in the 100s. Not the full consistent 150mbps that I paid for, but I've learned to be sadly complacent since Comcast has a monopoly on being the only high speed provider in my neighborhood. However, after 30 minutes to an hour or so it was in the low end again, around 10-20mbps.\nI have called Comcast twice. Both customer service were both wonderful and tried to help me to what they are able to do in the company. First one did a check on my speed and realized it was low so he scheduled someone to come look at it the next day. While I was at work I get a call from another Comcast rep who was trying to fix it through the routine reboot and wait. This guy was annoying. I told him I'm at work I can check my wifi from work fortunately through Google WiFi but I can't reset. I told him I'll call back and cancel the scheduled visit if I can do something on my end. Got home rebooted it near midnight was high speed again, and cancelled the visit thinking I'll see for a week what happens.\nSame thing happens and it's mostly random. I'm thinking it's basically when there's high traffic in my neighborhood or my modem keeps getting a mdds something error connection and I reboot it.\nThere is that glorious day when I reboot it and the speed is consistent for a while day. Rare.\nSecond time I called Comcast, it's a rep that's outsourced when though I called in the afternoon. Good guy but couldn't help me much like check my speed because he's limited in what to work with. Basically just said reboot it etc but the line seems solid from his end and that I should call the manufacturer.\nSo like every person who's had it, I've just been resetting my modem whenever it's slow. And if it's still slow I just think it's high traffic. If after the reset it's fast again, I think my connection somehow got screwed up.\nI was thinking of getting another modem, one that doesn't need to be rebooted all the time when slow, but I figured the modem is consistently connected to the internet, it's just the speed that varies. So I keep it and do my resets.\nThat's my experience. Good luck. Also the US should be getting 1gbps gigabyte per second by the way, like the rest of the developed countries. We're very behind because of the big monopolies in the us with our isps. Only Google is trying to spread the 1gbps speed but the rest of the companies like Comcast and Verizon are fighting them. So annoying."

I plugged in the \"Internet\" port of a Netgear AC1750 to it (owned for 3+ years), and use the Netgear for my DHCP server; its configuration web server sits on 192.168.0.1 and I don't have any problems using 192.168.0.x for all my home hosts while being able to also see 192.168.100.1 and, of course, Internet-based hosts. I don't have to program the Netgear to route through the MB7420; it knows that's the default route. The MB7420 then NATs to a 10.x.x.x IP that Charter assigns me (if I recall correctly). The MB7420 is also capable of getting one IPv6 IP, but mine shows as blank.\nIt has 16 downlink channels, 4 uplink. It gives freqs, channel numbers, dbmV, S/N ratio, and corr and uncorr errors for each freq., and it gives one log for all your ranging problems. Currently the software has reboot capability, but Charter took that feature out of my old Motorola box several months ago so they may do that again for this one.\nIt's passively cooled. The heatsink is close to the top of the box, and the box has plenty of holes in it to allow airflow (in via sides, out via top)."

     "comments": "Broke up my triple play and went with Sling TV (via Roku) but I stayed with my 15mb Internet feed from my ISP using an Arris Docsis 2 modem.\nBut my streaming sports & movies were choking.\nI installed a passive network tap and hooked up my sniffer which showed excessive buffering at a regular pace.\nI had my ISP come in to check out my 15mb service which, according to him, was perfect (why did I bother) and I showed him my captures of excessive buffering. He admitted he didn't understand my captures (good) but suggested I get a new DOCSIS 3 cable modem.\nI was skeptical so I bought this modem because it was the cheapest ISP approved modem.\nMy buffering problem went away.\nHasn't come back since I bought this DOCSIS 3 modem\nALSO. My Internet phone calls (an Obihai 110 box) in addition to the choking TV were breaking up with the Arris 2.0 and that went away also with this new Zoom modem.\nIn fact, my router was set for \"automatic shaping\" for QOS but I set it to a dedicated 512k up signal for voice and now no problems with voice (SIP).\nI've found that a 15mb Cable feed works with Sling TV alone but if I try to surf and stream music while watching TV my streamimg TV signal degrades. Streaming TV and talking on my internet phone is ok.\nHope this helps."

Reseting did nothing. I blamed the ISP at one point but decided to use logical deductions.\nLast night my internet went out for 11 hours. When my ISP opened, i picked up a rental to verify it was my modem and not the ISP. Sure enough, it was the modem. Now im outside the return window. I had a 5 year old motorala surfboard before it died. I expected more than 45 days. I do not recommend, but rather a surfboard even if Arris dawns the model now for 15 dollars more. Especially if you are a cord cutter like me with no cable. Don't make my mistake. Take the volume of reviews between the models as an indicator of what's known to be good."

I was having problems with my wifi connection constantly dropping and inconsistent connection speeds in general. I thought it was possible that it was my ISP, but figured trying a new modem would be my first check. This one completely resolved my issues. With the Netgear unit, my speed would vary from an at best 50 Mbps down to a common 5-10 Mbps. In addition, the wifi would constantly drop and force me to reboot the modem.\nThe Motorola works exactly as it needs to. Setup was easy, my speed is being reported at 60-65(I think I pay for 50 max) and I'm yet to have any wifi issues. Wifi works perfectly with my Macbook, iPhone and the other assorted items I have connected in my home(security cameras, lights).\nI'm very pleased with my decision to buy this."

Amazon shipping was terrible, it looked like someone took it off the shelf, Saran wrapped it, and put a shipping label on it. At least the modem/router still works."

I used to run xfinity's most current modem but could never get really decent speeds especially with the WiFi even woth tweaking settings the bestbi could. I used to average 20-60mbps down which is decent but not good enough for me. With the current setup, I'm getting 200+ consistently. First pic is on PC hardwired, the 2nd is on wifi on my phone, and 3rd is on my older ps4 hardwired. I'm assuming the ps4 is getting slower speeds due to the 100ft cat cable and it's also sharing the line with the home security camera system. I'm satisfied!"

All the cables are cat6 and cat 7.\n* You cannot have a control of upgrading the firmware - they control the upgrades for you.\n* I keep seeing some unidentified IP (hostname is \"Static IP\") connected to the router. I added it to the Mac address filtering - but it is still there. Doesn't look like the modem is really secure enough...\nUpdate:\n----------\nIt gets even worse than I thought: I was told by XFinity that they can update my modem remotely. without my permission. This is unbelievable and unprecedented in terms of privacy. I am not sure how Motorola and Xfinity got to this deal. But it raises big privacy concerns."

I would play Netflix / HBO GO shows / movies and it would die in the middle and needed to reconnect. I thought it was first just the Firestick but I have several Wemo's that were having the same periodic issues. I would loose connection and would have to hard restart the devices to get them to reconnect. I don't think it was my devices. I had no problems with my hardwired pc or my cell phones on this thing. I did not have time to troubleshoot this and ended up switching to a Arris cable modem only and a Nighthawk X4 wireless modem."
